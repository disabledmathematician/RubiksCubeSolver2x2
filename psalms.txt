Book 19 Psalms
B9P




 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
BITMTWNITCOT
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of
UNSITWOSNSITSO
the scornful.
TS


 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law
BHDIITLOTLAIHL
doth he meditate day and night.
DHMDAN


 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
AHSBLATPBTROW
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not
TBFHFIHSHLASN
wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
WAWHDSP


 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the
TUANSBALTCWT
wind driveth away.
WDA


 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
TTUSNSITJN
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
SITCOTR


 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way
FTLKTWOTRBTW
of the ungodly shall perish.
OTUSP


 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
WDTHRATPIAV
thing?
T


 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
TKOTESTATRT
counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
CTATLAAHAS


 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
LUBTBAACATC
from us.
FU


 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
HTSITHSLTLS
have them in derision.
HTID


 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
TSHSUTIHWAVTI
his sore displeasure.
HSD


 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
YHISMKUMHHOZ


 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
IWDTDTLHSUMT
art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
AMSTDHIBT


 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
AOMAISGTTHFT
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
IATUPOTEFTP


 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash
TSBTWAROITSD
them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
TIPLAPV


 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges
BWNTOYKBIYJ
of the earth.
OTE


 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
STLWFARWT


 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
KTSLHBAAYPFTW
when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put
WHWIKBALBAATTP
their trust in him.
TTIH


 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
LHATITTMMAT
that rise up against me.
TRUAM


 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
MTBWSOMSTINHFH
in God. Selah.
IGS


 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
BTOLAASFMMGAT
lifter up of mine head.
LUOMH


 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
ICUTLWMVAHHMOO
his holy hill. Selah.
HHHS


 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained
ILMDASIAFTLS
me.
M


 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have
IWNBAOTTOPTH
set themselves against me round about.
STAMRA


 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
AOLSMOMGFTHSA
mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
MEUTCBTHBTTOT
ungodly.
U


 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
SBUTLTBIUT
people. Selah.
PS


 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
HMWICOGOMRTH
enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my
EMWIWIDHMUMAHM
prayer.
P


 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
OYSOMHLWYTMGIS
how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
HLWYLVASALS


 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
BKTTLHSAHTIGF
himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
HTLWHWICUH


 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
SIAASNCWYOHU
your bed, and be still. Selah.
YBABSS


 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
OTSORAPYTI
the LORD.
TL


 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD,
TBMTSWWSUAGL
lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
LTUTLOTCUU


 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time
THPGIMHMTITT
that their corn and their wine increased.
TTCATWI


 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
IWBLMDIPASFTL
only makest me dwell in safety.
OMMDIS


 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
GETMWOLCMM


 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
HUTVOMCMKAMGF
unto thee will I pray.
UTWIP


 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
MVSTHITMOLIT
morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
MWIDMPUTAWLU


 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
FTANAGTHPIW
neither shall evil dwell with thee.
NSEDWT


 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
TFSNSITSTHA
workers of iniquity.
WOI


 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
TSDTTSLTLW
abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
ATBADM


 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude
BAFMIWCITHITM
of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
OTMAITFWIWTTHT


 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine
LMOLITRBOM
enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
EMTWSBMF


 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward
FTINFITMTI
part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
PIVWTTIAOST
flatter with their tongue.
FWTT


 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own
DTTOGLTFBTO
counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
CCTOITMOTTF
they have rebelled against thee.
THRAT


 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
BLATTPTTITRL
them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also
TESFJBTDTLTA
that love thy name be joyful in thee.
TLTNBJIT


 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
FTLWBTRWFW
thou compass him as with a shield.
TCHAWAS


 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
OLRMNITANCMI
thy hot displeasure.
THD


 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
HMUMOLFIAWOLHM
for my bones are vexed.
FMBAV


 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
MSIASVBTOLHL


 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
ROLDMSOSMFTM
sake.
S


 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave
FIDTINROTITG
who shall give thee thanks?
WSGTT


 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
IAWWMGATNMIMBT
swim; I water my couch with my tears.
SIWMCWMT


 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
MEICBOGIWOB
of all mine enemies.
OAME


 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD
DFMAYWOIFTL
hath heard the voice of my weeping.
HHTVOMW


 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive
TLHHMSTLWR
my prayer.
MP


 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
LAMEBAASVLT
return and be ashamed suddenly.
RABAS


 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
OLMGITDIPMTSMFA
them that persecute me, and deliver me:
TTPMADM


 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces,
LHTMSLALRIIP
while there is none to deliver.
WTINTD


 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in
OLMGIIHDTITBII
my hands;
MH


 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
IIHREUHTWAPWM
(yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
YIHDHTWCIME


 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
LTEPMSATIYLH
tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
TDMLUTEALMHITD
Selah.
S


 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of
AOLITALUTBO
the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou
TROMEAAFMTTJTT
hast commanded.
HC


 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
SSTCOTPCTA
for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
FTSTRTOH


 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
TLSJTPJMOLA
to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
TMRAATMITIIM


 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
OLTWOTWCTAEB
establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
ETJFTRGTTHAR


 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
MDIOGWSTUIH


 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
GJTRAGIAWTW
every day.
ED


 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his
IHTNHWWHSHHBH
bow, and made it ready.
BAMIR


 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
HHAPFHTIODH
ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
OHAATP


 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
BHTWIAHC
mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
MABFF


 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
HMAPADIAIFITD
which he made.
WHM


 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
HMSRUHOHAHV
dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
DSCDUHOP


 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
IWPTLATHRA
will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
WSPTTNOTLMH


 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the
OLOLHEITNIAT
earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
EWHSTGATH


 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
OOTMOBASHTO
strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy
SBOTETTMSTE
and the avenger.
ATA


 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the
WICTHTWOTFT
moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
MATSWTHO


 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of
WIMTTAMOHATSO
man, that thou visitest him?
MTTVH


 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
FTHMHALLTTAA
hast crowned him with glory and honour.
HCHWGAH


 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy
TMHTHDOTWOT
hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
HTHPATUHF


 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
ASAOYATBOTF


 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
TFOTAATFOTSAW
passeth through the paths of the seas.
PTTPOTS


 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
OLOLHEITNIATE


 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
IWPTOLWMWHIWS
forth all thy marvellous works.
FATMW


 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to
IWBGARITIWSPT
thy name, O thou most High.
TNOTMH


 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and
WMEATBTSFA
perish at thy presence.
PATP


 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest
FTHMMRAMCTS
in the throne judging right.
ITTJR


 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the
THRTHTHDT
wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
WTHPOTNFEAE


 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
OTEDACTAPEA
thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
THDCTMIPWT


 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
BTLSEFEHHPH
throne for judgment.
TFJ


 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
AHSJTWIRHS
minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
MJTTPIU


 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge
TLAWBARFTOAR
in times of trouble.
ITOT


 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:
ATTKTNWPTTIT
for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
FTLHNFTTST


 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
SPTTLWDIZD
among the people his doings.
ATPHD


 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them:
WHMIFBHRT
he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
HFNTCOTH


 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I
HMUMOLCMTWI
suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of
SOTTHMTTLMUFTGO
death:
D


 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
TIMSFATPITGOT
daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
DOZIWRITS


 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
THASDITPTTMIT
net which they hid is their own foot taken.
NWTHITOFT


 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
TLIKBTJWHET
wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
WISITWOHOHHS


 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations
TWSBTIHAATN
that forget God.
TFG


 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation
FTNSNABFTE
of the poor shall not perish for ever.
OTPSNPFE


 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be
AOLLNMPLTHB
judged in thy sight.
JITS


 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know
PTIFOLTTNMK
themselves to be but men. Selah.
TTBBMS


 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself
WSTAOOLWHTT
in times of trouble?
ITOT


 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
TWIHPDPTPLTB
taken in the devices that they have imagined.
TITDTTHI


 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
FTWBOHHDAB
the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
TCWTLA


 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
TWTTPOHCWN
seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
SAGGINIAHT


 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above
HWAAGTJAFA
out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
OOHSAFAHEHPAT


 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
HHSIHHISNBMFIS
never be in adversity.
NBIA


 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
HMIFOCADAFUH
tongue is mischief and vanity.
TIMAV


 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
HSITLPOTVIT
secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set
SPDHMTIHEAPS
against the poor.
ATP


 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
HLIWSAALIHDHLI
wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him
WTCTPHDCTPWHDH
into his net.
IHN


 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall
HCAHHTTPMF
by his strong ones.
BHSO


 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
HHSIHHGHFHHH
face; he will never see it.
FHWNSI


 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
AOLOGLUTHFNT
humble.
H


 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
WDTWCGHHSIH
heart, Thou wilt not require it.
HTWNRI


 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
THSIFTBMAST
requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou
RIWTHTPCHUTT
art the helper of the fatherless.
ATHOTF


 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
BTTAOTWATEMSO
his wickedness till thou find none.
HWTTFN


 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
TLIKFEAETHAP
out of his land.
OOHL


 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
LTHHTDOTHTW
prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
PTHTWCTETH


 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of
TJTFATOTTMO
the earth may no more oppress.
TEMNMO


 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
ITLPIMTHSYTMSFAA
bird to your mountain?
BTYM


 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
FLTWBTBTMRT
arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in
AUTSTTMPSATUI
heart.
H


 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
ITFBDWCTRD


 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
TLIIHHTTLTII
heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
HHEBHETTCOM


 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
TLTTRBTWAHT
loveth violence his soul hateth.
LVHSH


 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone,
UTWHSRSFAB
and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
AAHTTSBTPOTC


 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
FTRLLRHC
doth behold the upright.
DBTU


 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
HLFTGMCFTFF
from among the children of men.
FATCOM


 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
TSVEOWHNW
flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
FLAWADHDTS


 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
TLSCOAFLATT
that speaketh proud things:
TSPT


 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
WHSWOTWWPOLA
our own: who is lord over us?
OOWILOU


 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the
FTOOTPFTSOT
needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from
NNWIASTLIWSHISF
him that puffeth at him.
HTPAH


 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
TWOTLAPWASTIA
furnace of earth, purified seven times.
FOEPST


 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
TSKTOLTSPTF
this generation for ever.
TGFE


 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
TWWOESWTVMA
exalted.
E


 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long
HLWTFMOLFEHL
wilt thou hide thy face from me?
WTHTFFM


 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in
HLSITCIMSHSI
my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
MHDHLSMEBEOM


 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest
CAHMOLMGLMEL
I sleep the sleep of death;
ISTSOD


 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
LMESIHPAHAT
that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
TTMRWIAM


 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in
BIHTITMMHSRI
thy salvation.
TS


 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
IWSUTLBHHDB
with me.
WM


 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
TFHSIHHTINGTA
corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth
CTHDAWTINTD
good.
G


 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
TLLDFHUTCOM
to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
TSITWATDUASG


 They are all gone aside, they are all together become
TAAGATAATB
filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
FTINTDGNNO


 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
HATWOINKWEUM
people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
PATEBACNUTL


 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation
TWTIGFFGIITG
of the righteous.
OTR


 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
YHSTCOTPBTLI
his refuge.
HR


 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
OTTSOIWCOOZW
the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
TLBBTCOHPJS
rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
RAISBG


 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
LWSAITTWSDI
thy holy hill?
THH


 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
HTWUAWRA
speaketh the truth in his heart.
STTIHH


 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to
HTBNWHTNDET
his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
HNNTUARAHN


 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
IWEAVPICBHH
them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth
TTFTLHTSTHOHAC
not.
N


 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh
HTPNOHMTUNT
reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be
RATIHTDTTSNB
moved.
M


 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
PMOGFITDIPMT


 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord:
OMSTHSUTLTAML
my goodness extendeth not to thee;
MGENTT


 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the
BTTSTAITEATT
excellent, in whom is all my delight.
EIWIAMD


 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
TSSBMTHAA
god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their
GTDOOBWINONTUT
names into my lips.
NIML


 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
TLITPOMIAOMC
thou maintainest my lot.
TMML


 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have
TLAFUMIPPYIH
a goodly heritage.
AGH


 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
IWBTLWHGMCMR
also instruct me in the night seasons.
AIMITNS


 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
IHSTLABMBHIAM
right hand, I shall not be moved.
RHISNBM


 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
TMHIGAMGRMF
also shall rest in hope.
ASRIH


 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
FTWNLMSIHNWT
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
STHOTSC


 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is
TWSMTPOLITPI
fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
FOJATRHTAPFE


 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
HTROLAUMCGEUM
prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
PTGNOOFL


 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
LMSCFFTPLTE
behold the things that are equal.
BTTTAE


 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
THPMHTHVMIT
night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that
NTHTMASFNIAPT
my mouth shall not transgress.
MMSNT


 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
CTWOMBTWOTLIH
kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
KMFTPOTD


 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
HUMGITPTMFSN


 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God:
IHCUTFTWHMOG
incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
ITEUMAHMS


 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by
STMLOTTSB
thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise
TRHTWPTTITFTTR
up against them.
UAT


 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
KMATAOTEHMUTSO
thy wings,
TW


 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
FTWTOMFMDEW
compass me about.
CMA


 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
TAIITOFWTMT
speak proudly.
SP


 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
THNCUIOSTHST
eyes bowing down to the earth;
EBDTTE


 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
LAALTIGOHPAAIWA
young lion lurking in secret places.
YLLISP


 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my
AOLDHCHDDM
soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:
SFTWWITS


 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
FMWATHOLFMOTW
which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest
WHTPITLAWBTF
with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of
WTHTTAFOCALTRO
their substance to their babes.
TSTTB


 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall
AFMIWBTFIRIS
be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
BSWIAWTL


 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
IWLTOLMS


 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
TLIMRAMFAMDM
God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
GMSIWIWTMBATHOM
salvation, and my high tower.
SAMHT


 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
IWCUTLWIWTBPS
shall I be saved from mine enemies.
SIBSFME


 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
TSODCMATFOU
men made me afraid.
MMMA


 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
TSOHCMATSOD
prevented me.
PM


 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my
IMDICUTLACUM
God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him,
GHHMVOOHTAMCCBH
even into his ears.
EIHE


 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of
TTESATTFAO
the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
THMAWSBHWW


 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of
TWUASOOHNAFOO
his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
HMDCWKBI


 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
HBTHAACDADW
under his feet.
UHF


 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
AHRUACADFYHDFU
the wings of the wind.
TWOTW


 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
HMDHSPHPRA
him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
HWDWATCOTS


 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds
ATBTWBHHTC
passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
PHSACOF


 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
TLATITHATHG
his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
HVHSACOF


 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
YHSOHAASTAHS
out lightnings, and discomfited them.
OLADT


 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations
TTCOWWSATF
of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the
OTWWDATROLATBOT
breath of thy nostrils.
BOTN


 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many
HSFAHTMHDMOOM
waters.
W


 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
HDMFMSEAFTW
hated me: for they were too strong for me.
HMFTWTSFM


 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD
TPMITDOMCBTL
was my stay.
WMS


 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered
HBMFAIALPHD
me, because he delighted in me.
MBHDIM


 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
TLRMATMR
according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
ATTCOMHHHRM


 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
FIHKTWOTLAHNW
departed from my God.
DFMG


 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
FAHJWBMAIDNPA
his statutes from me.
HSFM


 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
IWAUBHAIKMFM
iniquity.
I


 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
THTLRMATM
righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
RATTCOMHIHE


 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
WTMTWSTMWA
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
UMTWSTU


 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
WTPTWSTPAWT
froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
FTWSTF


 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
FTWSTAPBWBD
high looks.
HL


 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will
FTWLMCTLMGW
enlighten my darkness.
EMD


 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
FBTIHRTATABMGHI
leaped over a wall.
LOAW


 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is
AFGHWIPTWOTLI
tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
THIABTATTTIH


 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
FWIGSTLOWIARSOG


 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
IIGTGMWSAMMW
perfect.
P


 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
HMMFLHFASMUM
high places.
HP


 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is
HTMHTWSTABOSI
broken by mine arms.
BBMA


 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
THAGMTSOTSAT
right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
RHHHMUATGHMMG


 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
THEMSUMTMFDN
slip.
S


 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did
IHPMEAOTND
I turn again till they were consumed.
ITATTWC


 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they
IHWTTTWNATRT
are fallen under my feet.
AFUMF


 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
FTHGMWSUTBT
hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
HSUMTTRUAM


 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
THAGMTNOMETI
might destroy them that hate me.
MDTTHM


 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
TCBTWNTSTEUT
LORD, but he answered them not.
LBHATN


 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I
TDIBTSATDBTWI
did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
DCTOATDITS


 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
THDMFTSOTPA
thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not
THMMTHOTHAPWIHN
known shall serve me.
KSSM


 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the
ASATHOMTSOMT
strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
SSSTUM


 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
TSSFAABAOOT
close places.
CP


 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of
TLLABBMRALTGO
my salvation be exalted.
MSBE


 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under
IIGTAMASTPU
me.
M


 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
HDMFMEYTLMU
above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the
ATTRUAMTHDMFT
violent man.
VM


 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
TWIGTUTOLAT
heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
HASPUTN


 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy
GDGHTHKASM
to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
THATDATHSFE


 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
THDTGOGATF
sheweth his handywork.
SHH


 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
DUDUSANUNS
knowledge.
K


 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
TINSNLWTVIN
heard.
H


 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their
TLIGOTATEAT
words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the
WTTEOTWITHHSATFT
sun,
S


 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
WIAABCOOHCA
rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
RAASMTRAR


 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his
HGFIFTEOTHAH
circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
CUTEOIATINHFTH
thereof.
T


 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
TLOTLIPCTST
testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
TOTLISMWTS


 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
TSOTLARRTHT
commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
COTLIPETE


 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
TFOTLICEFET
judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
JOTLATARA


 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
MTBDATTGYTMF
gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
GSATHATH


 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of
MBTITSWAIKO
them there is great reward.
TTIGR


 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
WCUHECTMFS
faults.
F


 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
KBTSAFPSLT
not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be
NHDOMTSIBUAISB
innocent from the great transgression.
IFTGT


 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,
LTWOMMATMOMH
be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
BAITSOLMSAMR


 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the
TLHTITDOTTNOT
God of Jacob defend thee;
GOJDT


 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out
STHFTSASTO
of Zion;
OZ


 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
RATOAATBS
Selah.
S


 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
GTATTOHAFAT
counsel.
C


 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
WWRITSAITNOOG
we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
WWSUOBTLFATP


 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear
NKITTLSHAHWH
him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
HFHHHWTSSOHRH


 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
STICASIHBWW
remember the name of the LORD our God.
RTNOTLOG


 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and
TABDAFBWARA
stand upright.
SU


 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
SLLTKHUWWC


 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
TKSJITSOLAIT
salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
SHGSHR


 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
THGHHHDAHN
withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
WTROHLS


 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
FTPHWTBOGT
settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
SACOPGOHH


 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length
HALOTATGIHEL
of days for ever and ever.
ODFEAE


 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
HGIGITSHAMH
thou laid upon him.
TLUH


 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
FTHMHMBFETHM
him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
HEGWTC


 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
FTKTITLATTMO
the most High he shall not be moved.
TMHHSNBM


 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
THSFOATETRH
shall find out those that hate thee.
SFOTTHT


 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
TSMTAAFOITTOT
anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall
ATLSSTUIHWATFS
devour them.
DT


 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their
TFSTDFTEAT
seed from among the children of men.
SFATCOM


 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
FTIEATTIA
mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
MDWTANATP


 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
TSTMTTTBWT
shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of
SMRTAUTSATFO
them.
T


 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we
BTELITOSSWW
sing and praise thy power.
SAPTP


 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so
MGMGWHTFMWATS
far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
FFHMAFTWOMR


 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and
OMGICITDTBTHNA
in the night season, and am not silent.
ITNSAANS


 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
BTAHOTTITPO
Israel.
I


 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
OFTITTTATD
deliver them.
DT


 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
TCUTAWDTTI
thee, and were not confounded.
TAWNC


 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
BIAAWANMAROMAD
of the people.
OTP


 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
ATTSMLMTSTSOT
lip, they shake the head, saying,
LTSTHS


 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
HTOTLTHWDHLH
deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
DHSHDIH


 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst
BTAHTTMOOTWTD
make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
MMHWIWUMMB


 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
IWCUTFTWTAMGFM
mother's belly.
MB


 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none
BNFFMFTINFTIN
to help.
TH


 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
MBHCMSBOBH
beset me round.
BMR


 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
TGUMWTMAARAA
roaring lion.
RL


 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of
IAPOLWAAMBAOO
joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
JMHILWIIMITMOMB


 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
MSIDULAPAMT
cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
CTMJATHBMITDOD


 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
FDHCMTAOTWH
inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
IMTPMHAMF


 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
IMTAMBTLASUM


 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
TPMGATACLUM
vesture.
V


 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste
BBNTFFMOLOMSH
thee to help me.
TTHM


 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
DMSFTSMDFTPO
the dog.
TD


 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from
SMFTLMFTHHMF
the horns of the unicorns.
THOTU


 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of
IWDTNUMBITMO
the congregation will I praise thee.
TCWIPT


 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
YTFTLPHAYTSOJ
glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
GHAFHAYTSOI


 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
FHHNDNATAOT
afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried
ANHHHHFFHBWHC
unto him, he heard.
UHHH


 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
MPSBOTITGCIW
pay my vows before them that fear him.
PMVBTTFH


 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
TMSEABSTSPT
LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
LTSHYHSLFE


 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
ATEOTWSRATUT
LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
LAATKOTNSWBT


 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
FTKITLAHITGA
the nations.
TN


 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
ATTBFUESEAWA
they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep
TTGDTTDSBBHANCK
alive his own soul.
AHOS


 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord
ASSSHISBATTL
for a generation.
FAG


 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
TSCASDHRUA
people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
PTSBBTHHDT


 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
TLIMSISNW


 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
HMMTLDIGPHLM
beside the still waters.
BTSW


 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
HRMSHLMITPO
righteousness for his name's sake.
RFHNS


 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
YTIWTTVOTSO
death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
DIWFNEFTAWMTRATS
they comfort me.
TCM


 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
TPATBMITPOM
enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
ETAMHWOMCRO


 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
SGAMSFMATDOM
life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
LAIWDITHOTLFE


 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
TEITLATFTTW
and they that dwell therein.
ATTDT


 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it
FHHFIUTSAEI
upon the floods.
UTF


 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall
WSAITHOTLOWS
stand in his holy place?
SIHHP


 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
HTHCHAAPHWHN
lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
LUHSUVNSD


 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and
HSRTBFTLA
righteousness from the God of his salvation.
RFTGOHS


 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
TITGOTTSHTST
face, O Jacob. Selah.
FOJS


 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
LUYHOYGABYLUY
everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
EDATKOGSCI


 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
WITKOGTLSAMT
LORD mighty in battle.
LMIB


 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
LUYHOYGELTUY
everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
EDATKOGSCI


 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
WITKOGTLOHHITK
of glory. Selah.
OGS


 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
UTOLDILUMS


 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not
OMGITITLMNBALN
mine enemies triumph over me.
METOM


 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
YLNTWOTBALTB
ashamed which transgress without cause.
AWTWC


 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
SMTWOLTMTP


 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of
LMITTATMFTATGO
my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
MSOTDIWATD


 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy
ROLTTMAT
lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
LFTHBEOO


 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
RNTSOMYNMT
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
ATTMRTMFTGSOL


 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach
GAUITLTWHT
sinners in the way.
SITW


 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he
TMWHGIJATMWH
teach his way.
THW


 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
ATPOTLAMATUSA
keep his covenant and his testimonies.
KHCAHT


 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
FTNSOLPMIFII
great.
G


 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
WMIHTFTLHSHTI
the way that he shall choose.
TWTHSC


 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
HSSDAEAHSSIT
earth.
E


 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he
TSOTLIWTTFHAH
will shew them his covenant.
WSTHC


 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my
MEAETTLFHSPM
feet out of the net.
FOOTN


 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
TTUMAHMUMFIAD
and afflicted.
AA


 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out
TTOMHAEOBTMO
of my distresses.
OMD


 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
LUMAAMPAFAM
sins.
S


 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
CMEFTAMATHM
with cruel hatred.
WCH


 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
OKMSADMLMNBAFI
put my trust in thee.
PMTIT


 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on
LIAUPMFIWO
thee.
T


 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
RIOGOOAHT


 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I
JMOLFIHWIMII
have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
HTAITLTISNS


 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
EMOLAPMTMRAMH


 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have
FTLIBMEAIH
walked in thy truth.
WITT


 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
IHNSWVPNWIGIW
dissemblers.
D


 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not
IHHTCOEDAWN
sit with the wicked.
SWTW


 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
IWWMHIISWICT
altar, O LORD:
AOL


 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell
TIMPWTVOTAT
of all thy wondrous works.
OATWW


 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the
LIHLTHOTHAT
place where thine honour dwelleth.
PWTHD


 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody
GNMSWSNMLWB
men:
M


 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
IWHIMATRHIFO
bribes.
B


 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
BAFMIWWIMIRMA
be merciful unto me.
BMUM


 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will
MFSIAEPITCW
I bless the LORD.
IBTL


 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
TLIMLAMSWSIF
the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
TLITSOMLOWSIBA


 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
WTWEMEAMFCUM
to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
TEUMFTSAF


 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
TAHSEAMMHSN
fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
FTWSRAMITWIBC


 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek
OTHIDOTLTWIS
after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
ATIMDITHOTLATDOM
life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
LTBTBOTLATEIHT


 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
FITTOTHSHMIHP
in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up
ITSOHTSHHMHSSMU
upon a rock.
UAR


 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies
ANSMHBLUAME
round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
RAMTWIOIHTSO
joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
JIWSYIWSPUTL


 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
HOLWICWMVHMAU
me, and answer me.
MAAM


 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
WTSSYMFMHSUT
Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
TFLWIS


 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
HNTFFFMPNTSAI
anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God
ATHBMHLMNNFMOG
of my salvation.
OMS


 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
WMFAMMFMTTLW
take me up.
TMU


 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path,
TMTWOLALMIAPP
because of mine enemies.
BOME


 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
DMNOUTWOMEFF
witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
WARUAMASABOC


 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
IHFUIHBTSTGO
the LORD in the land of the living.
TLITLOTL


 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall
WOTLBOGCAHS
strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
STHWISOTL


 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
UTWICOLMRBNSTM
lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the
LITBSTMIBLTTGDIT
pit.
P


 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,
HTVOMSWICUT
when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
WILUMHTTHO


 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
DMNAWTWAWTWO
iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in
IWSPTTNBMII
their hearts.
TH


 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
GTATTDAATT
wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their
WOTEGTATWOT
hands; render to them their desert.
HRTTTD


 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
BTRNTWOTLNT
operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
OOHHHSDTANBTU


 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
BBTLBHHHTVOM
supplications.
S


 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
TLIMSAMSMHTI
him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my
HAIAHTMHGRAWM
song will I praise him.
SWIPH


 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
TLITSAHITSSO
his anointed.
HA


 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them
STPABTIFT
also, and lift them up for ever.
AALTUFE


 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory
GUTLOYMGUTLG
and strength.
AS


 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
GUTLTGDUHNWT
LORD in the beauty of holiness.
LITBOH


 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
TVOTLIUTWTGOG
thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.
TTLIUMW


 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
TVOTLIPTVOTLI
full of majesty.
FOM


 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
TVOTLBTCYTL
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
BTCOL


 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
HMTATSLACLAS
like a young unicorn.
LAYU


 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
TVOTLDTFOF


 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD
TVOTLSTWTL
shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
STWOK


 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
TVOTLMTHTCA
discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his
DTFAIHTDEOSOH
glory.
G


 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
TLSUTFYTLSK
for ever.
FE


 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
TLWGSUHPTLW
bless his people with peace.
BHPWP


 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
IWETOLFTHLMUA
hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
HNMMFTROM


 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
OLMGICUTATHHM


 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou
OLTHBUMSFTGT
hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
HKMATISNGDTTP


 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at
SUTLOYSOHAGTA
the remembrance of his holiness.
TROHH


 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
FHAEBAMIHFIL
weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
WMEFANBJCITM


 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
AIMPISISNBM


 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
LBTFTHMMMTS
strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
STDHTFAIWT


 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
ICTTOLAUTLIM
supplication.
S


 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
WPITIMBWIGDTTP
Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
STDPTSIDTT


 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my
HOLAHMUMLBTM
helper.
H


 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
THTFMMMIDTH
put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
POMSAGMWG


 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
TTETMGMSPTTANB
silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
SOLMGIWGTUTFE


 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
ITOLDIPMTLMNBA
deliver me in thy righteousness.
DMITR


 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
BDTETMDMSBTM
strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
SRFAHODTSM


 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy
FTAMRAMFTFT
name's sake lead me, and guide me.
NSLMAGM


 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me:
PMOOTNTTHLPFM
for thou art my strength.
FTAMS


 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
ITHICMSTHRMO
LORD God of truth.
LGOT


 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
IHHTTRLVBITI
the LORD.
TL


 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
IWBGARITMFTH
considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
CMTTHKMSIA


 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou
AHNSMUITHOTET
hast set my feet in a large room.
HSMFIALR


 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
HMUMOLFIAITMEI
consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
CWGYMSAMB


 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing:
FMLISWGAMYWS
my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
MSFBOMIAMBA
consumed.
C


 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially
IWARAAMEBE
among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see
AMNAAFTMATTDS
me without fled from me.
MWFFM


 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
IAFAADMOOMIALAB
vessel.
V


 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every
FIHHTSOMFWOE
side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take
SWTTCTAMTDTT
away my life.
AML


 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
BITITOLISTAMG


 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
MTAITHDMFTHOM
enemies, and from them that persecute me.
EAFTTPM


 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
MTFTSUTSSMFT
mercies' sake.
MS


 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
LMNBAOLFIHCUT
let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
LTWBAALTBSITG


 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
LTLLBPTSWSG
things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
TPACATR


 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for
OHGITGWTHLUF
them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
TTFTWTHWFTTTI
thee before the sons of men!
TBTSOM


 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
TSHTITSOTPFT
pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
POMTSKTSIAPFT
strife of tongues.
SOT


 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
BBTLFHHSMHM
kindness in a strong city.
KIASC


 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
FISIMHIACOFBTE
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
NTHTVOMSWIC
unto thee.
UT


 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
OLTLAYHSFTLP
the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
TFAPRTPD


 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all
BOGCAHSSYHA
ye that hope in the LORD.

 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
BIHWTIFWSI
covered.

 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
BITMUWTLINI
and in whose spirit there is no guile.
AIWSTING


 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring
WIKSMBWOTMR
all the day long.
ATDL


 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
FDANTHWHUMMMI
turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
TITDOSS


 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
IAMSUTAMIHIN
hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou
HISIWCMTUTLAT
forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
FTIOMSS


 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
FTSEOTIGPUTIA
time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters
TWTMBFSITFOGW
they shall not come nigh unto him.
TSNCNUH


 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from
TAMHPTSPMF
trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
TTSCMAWSODS


 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
IWITATTITWWT
shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
SGIWGTWME


 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
BYNATHOATMWHN
understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
UWMMBHIWBABL
they come near unto thee.
TCNUT


 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
MSSBTTWBHTTI
the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
FJAYTAUIH


 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely
RITLOYRFPIC
for the upright.

 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery
PTLWHSUHWTP
and an instrument of ten strings.
AAIOTS


 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
SUHANSPSWALN


 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are
FTWOTLIRAAHWA
done in truth.
DIT


 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of
HLRAJTEIFO
the goodness of the LORD.
TGOTL


 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
BTWOTLWTHMAAT
host of them by the breath of his mouth.
HOTBTBOHM


 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
HGTWOTSTAAHH
layeth up the depth in storehouses.
LUTDIS


 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
LATEFTLLATIO
the world stand in awe of him.
TWSIAOH


 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
FHSAIWDHCAIS
fast.
F


 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
TLBTCOTHTNH
maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
MTDOTPONE


 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of
TCOTLSFETTO
his heart to all generations.
HHTAG


 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
BITNWGITLATP
whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
WHHCFHOI


 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
TLLFHHBATSO
men.
M


 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
FTPOHHHLUAT
inhabitants of the earth.
IOTE


 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
HFTHAHCAT
works.
W


 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
TINKSBTMOAHAM
man is not delivered by much strength.
MINDBMS


 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he
AHIAVTFSNSH
deliver any by his great strength.
DABHGS


 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
BTEOTLIUTTFHU
them that hope in his mercy;
TTHIHM


 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
TDTSFDATKTAI
famine.
F


 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our
OSWFTLHIOHAO
shield.
S


 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted
FOHSRIHBWHT
in his holy name.
IHHN


 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
LTMOLBUUAAWHI
thee.
T


 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
IWBTLAATHPS
continually be in my mouth.

 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
MSSMHBITLTHS
hear thereof, and be glad.

 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
OMTLWMALUEHN
together.

all my fears.

were not ashamed.

 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him
TPMCATLHHASH
out of all his troubles.

him, and delivereth them.

that trusteth in him.
TTIH


 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
OFTLYHSFTINWTT
that fear him.
TFH


 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that
TYLDLASHBTT
seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
STLSNWAGT


 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the
CYCHUMIWTYT
fear of the LORD.

 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days,
WMIHTDLALMD
that he may see good?

 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
DFEADGSPAPI


 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears
TEOTLAUTRAHE
are open unto their cry.
AOUTC


 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut
TFOTLIATTDETC
off the remembrance of them from the earth.
OTROTFTE


 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
TRCATLHADT
out of all their troubles.

saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of
TLRTSOHSANO
them that trust in him shall be desolate.
TTTIHSBD


 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
PMCOLWTTSWMF
against them that fight against me.
ATTFAM


 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
THOSABASUFMH


 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
DOATSASTWATT
persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
PMSUMSIATS


 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
LTBCAPTSTSAM
soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my
SLTBTBABTCTDM
hurt.
H


 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of
LTBACBTWALTAO
the LORD chase them.
TLCT


 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
LTWBDASALTAOT
LORD persecute them.
LPT


 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
FWCHTHFMTNIAP
which without cause they have digged for my soul.
WWCTHDFMS


 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
LDCUHAUALHN
that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him
THHHCHITVDLH
fall.
F


 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
AMSSBJITLISRI
his salvation.
HS


 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
AMBSSLWILUTW
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor
DTPFHTITSFHYTP
and the needy from him that spoileth him?
ATNFHTSH


 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
FWDRUTLTMCT
that I knew not.
TIKN


 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
TRMEFGTTSOMS


 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was
BAFMWTWSMCW
sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
SIHMSWFAMPRI
mine own bosom.
MOB


 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother:
IBMATHHBMFOB
I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
IBDHAOTMFHM


 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
BIMATRAGT
together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and
TYTAGTTAMA
I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
IKINTDTMACN


 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me
WHMIFTGUM
with their teeth.
WTT


 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
LHLWTLORMSFT
destructions, my darling from the lions.
DMDFTL


 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
IWGTTITGCIW
praise thee among much people.
PTAMP


 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over
LNTTAMEWRO
me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
MNLTWWTETHMWAC


 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
FTSNPBTDDM
against them that are quiet in the land.
ATTAQITL


 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
YTOTMWAMASA
aha, our eye hath seen it.
AOEHSI


 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be
TTHSOLKNSOLB
not far from me.
NFFM


 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my
SUTAATMJEUM
cause, my God and my Lord.
CMGAML


 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
JMOLMGATTRA
let them not rejoice over me.
LTNROM


 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it:
LTNSITHASWWHI
let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
LTNSWHSHU


 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
LTBAABTCTT
rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that
RAMHLTBCWSADT
magnify themselves against me.
MTAM


 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my
LTSFJABGTFM
righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
RCYLTSCLTLB
magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
MWHPITPOHS


 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
AMTSSOTRAOT
praise all the day long.
PATDL


 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
TTOTWSWMHT
there is no fear of God before his eyes.
TINFOGBHE


 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his
FHFHIHOEUH
iniquity be found to be hateful.
IBFTBH


 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
TWOHMAIADHHL
off to be wise, and to do good.
OTBWATDG


 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a
HDMUHBHSHIA
way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
WTINGHANE


 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
TMOLIITHATF
reacheth unto the clouds.
RUTC


 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
TRILTGMTJ
are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
AAGDOLTPMAB


 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
HEITLOGTT
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
COMPTTUTSOTW


 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
TSBASWTFOT
house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
HATSMTDOTROTP


 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
FWTITFOLITLSW
see light.
SL


 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
OCTLUTTKTA
thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
TRTTUIH


 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
LNTFOPCAMALNT
hand of the wicked remove me.
HOTWRM


 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast
TATWOIFTAC
down, and shall not be able to rise.
DASNBATR


 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou
FNTBOENBT
envious against the workers of iniquity.
EATWOI


 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither
FTSSBCDLTGAW
as the green herb.
ATGH


 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
TITLADGSSTDIT
land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
LAVTSBF


 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
DTAITLAHSGTT
desires of thine heart.
DOTH


 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he
CTWUTLTAIHAH
shall bring it to pass.
SBITP


 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
AHSBFTRATLA
thy judgment as the noonday.
TJATN


 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not
RITLAWPFHFN
thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
TBOHWPIHWBOTM
who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
WBWDTP


 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
CFAAFWFNTIA
wise to do evil.
WTDE


 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
FESBCOBTTWUT
LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
LTSITE


 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea,
FYALWATWSNBY
thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
TSDCHPAISNB


 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
BTMSITEASD
themselves in the abundance of peace.
TITAOP


 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
TWPATJAGUH
with his teeth.
WHT


 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
TLSLAHFHSTHDI
coming.
C


 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their
TWHDOTSAHBT
bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright
BTCDTPANATSSABOU
conversation.
C


 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
TSSEITOHATB
shall be broken.
SBB


 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
ALTARMHIBTTR
of many wicked.
OMW


 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
FTAOTWSBBBTL
upholdeth the righteous.
UTR


 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
TLKTDOTUAT
inheritance shall be for ever.
ISBFE


 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days
TSNBAITETAITD
of famine they shall be satisfied.
OFTSBS


 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD
BTWSPATEOTL
shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they
SBATFOLTSCISST
consume away.
CA


 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the
TWBAPNABT
righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
RSMAG


 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
FSABBOHSITEA
they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
TTBCOHSBCO


 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
TSOAGMAOBTLAH
delighteth in his way.
DIHW


 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
THFHSNBUCDFT
LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
LUHWHH


 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
IHBYANAOYHINST
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
RFNHSBB


 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
HIEMALAHSIB


 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
DFEADGADFE


 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
FTLLJAFNHS
they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut
TAPFEBTSOTWSBC
off.
O


 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
TRSITLADTF
ever.
E


 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
TMOTRSWAHT
talketh of judgment.
TOJ


 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
TLOHGIIHHNOHSS
slide.
S


 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
TWWTRASTSH


 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him
TLWNLHIHHNCH
when he is judged.
WHIJ


 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee
WOTLAKHWAHSET
to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
TITLWTWACOTSSI


 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
IHSTWIGPASH
like a green bay tree.
LAGBT


 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
YHPAALHWNYISH
but he could not be found.
BHCNBF


 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
MTPMABTUFTEO
that man is peace.
TMIP


 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end
BTTSBDTTE
of the wicked shall be cut off.
OTWSBCO


 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is
BTSOTRIOTLHI
their strength in the time of trouble.
TSITTOT


 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
ATLSHTADTHS
deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
DTFTWASTBTTIH


 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in
OLRMNITWNCMI
thy hot displeasure.
THD


 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
FTASFIMATHPM
sore.
S


 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
TINSIMFBOTA
neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
NITARIMBBOMS


 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
FMIAGOMHAAH
burden they are too heavy for me.
BTATHFM


 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
MWSAACBOMF


 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all
IATIABDGIGMA
the day long.
TDL


 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there
FMLAFWALDAT
is no soundness in my flesh.
INSIMF


 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
IAFASBIHRBROT
disquietness of my heart.
DOMH


 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not
LAMDIBTAMGIN
hid from thee.
HFT


 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light
MHPMSFMAFTL
of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
OMEIAIGFM


 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
MLAMFSAFMSAM
kinsmen stand afar off.
KSAO


 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and
TATSAMLLSFMA
they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits
TTSMHSMTAID
all the day long.
ATDL


 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man
BIAADMHNAIWAADM
that openeth not his mouth.
TONHM


 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
TIWAAMTHNAIWMA
no reproofs.
NR


 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my
FITOLDIHTWHOLM
God.
G


 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
FISHMLOTSRO
me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
MWMFSTMTAM


 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
FIARTHAMSICB
me.
M


 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my
FIWDMIIWBSFM
sin.
S


 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
BMEALATASAT
that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
THMWAM


 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
TATREFGAMA
because I follow the thing that good is.
BIFTTTGI


 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
FMNOLOMGBNFFM


 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
MHTHMOLMS


 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
ISIWTHTMWTISNWM
tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before
TIWKMMWABWTWIB
me.
M


 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good;
IWDWSIHMPEFG
and my sorrow was stirred.
AMSWS


 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
MHWHWMWIWMTF
burned: then spake I with my tongue,
BTSIWMT


 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
LMMTKMEATMOMD
what it is: that I may know how frail I am.
WIITIMKHFIA


 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine
BTHMMDAAHAM
age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is
AIANBTVEMAHBSI
altogether vanity. Selah.
AVS


 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
SEMWIAVSSTA
disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall
DIVHHURAKNWS
gather them.
GT


 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
ANLWWIFMHIIT


 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
DMFAMTMMNT
reproach of the foolish.
ROTF


 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
IWDIONMMBTDI


 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
RTSAFMIACBTBO
thine hand.
TH


 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
WTWRDCMFIT
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is
MHBTCALAMSEMI
vanity. Selah.
VS


 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not
HMPOLAGEUMCHN
thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner,
TPAMTFIAASWTAAS
as all my fathers were.
AAMFW


 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
OSMTIMRSBIGH
and be no more.
ABNM


 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me,
IWPFTLAHIUM
and heard my cry.
AHMC


 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the
HBMUAOOAHPOOT
miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
MCASMFUARAEMG


 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
AHHPANSIMMEPUO
God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
GMSSIAFASTITL


 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
BITMTMTLHTA
respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
RNTPNSATATL


 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
MOLMGATWWWTH
done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up
DATTWATUTCBRU
in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more
IOUTIIWDASOTTAM
than can be numbered.
TCBN


 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
SAOTDNDMEH
thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
TOBOASOHTNR


 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
TSILICITVOTBII
written of me,
WOM


 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within
IDTDTWOMGYTLIW
my heart.
MH


 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo,
IHPRITGCL
I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
IHNRMLOLTK


 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
IHNHTRWMHIH
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
DTFATSIHNCT
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
LATTFTGC


 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let
WNTTTMFMOLL
thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
TLATTCPM


 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine
FIEHCMAM
iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
IHTHUMSTIANATLU
they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth
TAMTTHOMHTMHF
me.
M


 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to
BPOLTDMOLMHT
help me.
HM


 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after
LTBAACTTSA
my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame
MSTDILTBDBAPTS
that wish me evil.
TWME


 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say
LTBDFAROTSTS
unto me, Aha, aha.
UMAA


 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:
LATTSTRABGIT
let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
LSALTSSCTLBM


 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
BIAPANYTLTUMT
art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
AMHAMDMNTOMG


 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will
BIHTCTPTLW
deliver him in time of trouble.
DHITOT


 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
TLWPHAKHAAHS
be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will
BBUTEATWNDHUTW
of his enemies.
OHE


 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing:
TLWSHUTBOL
thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
TWMAHBIHS


 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
ISLBMUMHMSFIH
sinned against thee.
SAT


 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his
MESEOMWSHDAH
name perish?
NP


 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
AIHCTSMHSVHH
gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
GITIWHGAHTI


 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
ATHMWTAMAMD
they devise my hurt.
TDMH


 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
AEDSTCFUHAN
that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
THLHSRUNM


 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
YMOFFIWITWD
eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
EOMBHLUHHAM


 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that
BTOLBMUMARMUT
I may requite them.
IMRT


 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy
BTIKTTFMBME
doth not triumph over me.
DNTOM


 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
AAFMTUMIMIA
settest me before thy face for ever.
SMBTFFE


 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
BBTLGOIFEAT
everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
EAAA


 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my
ATHPATWBSPM
soul after thee, O God.
SATOG


 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
MSTFGFTLGWSI
come and appear before God?
CAABG


 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
MTHBMMDANWT
continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
CSUMWITG


 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for
WIRTTIPOMSIMF
I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God,
IHGWTMIWWTTTHOG
with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
WTVOJAPWAMTKH


 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou
WATCDOMSAWAT
disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
DIMHTIGFISYPHFT
help of his countenance.
HOHC


 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
OMGMSICDWMTWI
remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the
RTFTLOJAOTHFT
hill Mizar.
HM


 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
DCUDATNOTWA
thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
TWATBAGOM


 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day
YTLWCHLITD
time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
TAITNHSSBWMAMPU
the God of my life.
TGOML


 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
IWSUGMRWHTFMW
go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
GIMBOTOOTE


 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
AWASIMBMERMW
they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
TSDUMWITG


 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou
WATCDOMSAWAT
disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
DWMHTIGFISYPHW
is the health of my countenance, and my God.
ITHOMCAMG


 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly
JMOGAPMCAAU
nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
NODMFTDAUM


 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
FTATGOMSWDTCM
off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
OWGIMBOTOOTE


 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let
OSOTLATTLTLML
them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
TBMUTHHATTT


 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
TWIGUTAOGUGME
joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
JYUTHWIPTOGMG


 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou
WATCDOMSAWAT
disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is
DWMHIGFISYPHWI
the health of my countenance, and my God.
THOMCAMG


 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told
WHHWOEOGOFHT
us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
UWWTDITDITTOO


 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
HTDDOTHWTHA
plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
PTHTDATPACTO


 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
FTGNTLIPBTOS
neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm,
NDTOASTBTRHATA
and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto
ATLOTCBTHAFU
them.
T


 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
TAMKOGCDFJ


 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
TTWWPDOETTN
will we tread them under that rise up against us.
WWTTUTRUAU


 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
FIWNTIMBNSMSS
me.
M


 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them
BTHSUFOEAHPT
to shame that hated us.
TSTHU


 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
IGWBATDLAPTNF
ever. Selah.
ES


 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
BTHCOAPUTSAGN
forth with our armies.
FWOA


 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
TMUTTBFTEATW
hate us spoil for themselves.
HUSFT


 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
THGULSAFMAH
scattered us among the heathen.
SUATH


 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase
TSTPFNADNI
thy wealth by their price.
TWBTP


 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
TMUARTONASAA
derision to them that are round about us.
DTTTARAU


 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
TMUABATHASOT
head among the people.
HATP


 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
MCICBMATSOM
face hath covered me,
FHCM


 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
FTVOHTRABB
reason of the enemy and avenger.
ROTEAA


 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
ATICUUYHWNFT
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
NHWDFITC


 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps
OHINTBNHOS
declined from thy way;
DFTW


 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
TTHSBUITPODA
covered us with the shadow of death.
CUWTSOD


 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out
IWHFTNOOGOSO
our hands to a strange god;
OHTASG


 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
SNGSTOFHKTSO
the heart.
TH


 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
YFTSAWKATDLWA
counted as sheep for the slaughter.
CASFTS


 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
AWSTOLACUNOF
ever.
E


 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our
WHTTFAFO
affliction and our oppression?
AAOO


 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
FOSIBDTTDOBC
unto the earth.
UTE


 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
AFOHARUFTMS


 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
MHIIAGMISOTT
which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready
WIHMTTKMTITPOAR
writer.
W


 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured
TAFTTCOMGIP
into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
ITLTGHBTFE


 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
GTSUTTOMMWTG
and thy majesty.
ATM


 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
AITMRPBOTA
meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee
MARATRHSTT
terrible things.
TT


 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
TAASITHOTKE
whereby the people fall under thee.
WTPFUT


 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
TTOGIFEAETSOT
kingdom is a right sceptre.
KIARS


 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
TLRAHWT
God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
GTGHATWTOOGAT
fellows.
F


 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out
ATGSOMAAACO
of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
OTIPWTHMTG


 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
KDWATHWUT
right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
RHDSTQIGOO


 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
HODACAITE
forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
FATOPATFH


 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
SSTKGDTBFHIT
Lord; and worship thou him.
LAWTH


 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even
ATDOTSBTWAGE
the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
TRATPSITF


 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is
TKDIAGWHCI
of wrought gold.
OWG


 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
SSBBUTKIRON
the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
TVHCTFHSBBUT


 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they
WGARSTBBT
shall enter into the king's palace.
SEITKP


 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou
IOTFSBTCWT
mayest make princes in all the earth.
MMPIATE


 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
IWMTNTBRIAG
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
TSTPPTFEAE


 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
GIORASAVPHI
trouble.
T


 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
TWNWFTTEBRA
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
TTMBCITMOTS


 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
TTWTRABTTT
mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
MSWTSTS


 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the
TIARTSWSMGT
city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
COGTHPOTTOTMH


 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God
GIITMOHSSNBMG
shall help her, and that right early.
SHHATRE


 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
THRTKWMHUH
voice, the earth melted.
VTEM


 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our
TLOHIWUTGOJIO
refuge. Selah.
RS


 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
CBTWOTLWDHH
made in the earth.
MITE


 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he
HMWTCUTEOTEH
breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
BTBACTSISHBT
chariot in the fire.
CITF


 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among
BSAKTIAGIWBEA
the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
THIWBEITE


 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our
TLOHIWUTGOJIO
refuge. Selah.
RS


 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
OCYHAYPSUGWT
voice of triumph.
VOT


 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
FTLMHITHIAGKO
all the earth.
ATE


 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under
HSSTPUUATNU
our feet.
OF


 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
HSCOIFUTEO
Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
JWHLS


 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
GIGUWASTLWTSOA
trumpet.
T


 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our
SPTGSPSPUO
King, sing praises.
KSP


 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
FGITKOATESYPW
understanding.
U


 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne
GROTHGSUTT
of his holiness.
OHH


 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
TPOTPAGTET
people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto
POTGOAFTSOTEBU
God: he is greatly exalted.
GHIGE


 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
GITLAGTBPITCO
our God, in the mountain of his holiness.
OGITMOHH


 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is
BFSTJOTWEI
mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
MZOTSOTNTCOTGK


 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
GIKIHPFAR


 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
FLTKWATPBT


 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
TSIASTMTWTA
hasted away.
HA


 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
FTHUTTAPAOAWI
travail.
T


 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
TBTSOTWAEW


 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
AWHHSHWSITCOTLO
hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
HITCOOGGWEIFES


 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst
WHTOTLOGITM
of thy temple.
OTT


 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
ATTNOGSITPUTE
of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
OTETRHIFOR


 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
LMZRLTDOJBG
because of thy judgments.
BOTJ


 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
WAZAGRAHTTT
thereof.
T


 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
MYWHBCHPTYM
tell it to the generation following.
TITTGF


 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
FTGIOGFEAEHWBO
guide even unto death.
GEUD


 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of
HTAYPGEAYIO
the world:
TW


 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
BLAHRAPT


 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my
MMSSOWATMOM
heart shall be of understanding.
HSBOU


 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
IWIMETAPIWOMD
saying upon the harp.
SUTH


 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the
WSIFITDOEWT
iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
IOMHSCMA


 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
TTTITWABTIT
multitude of their riches;
MOTR


 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give
NOTCBAMRHBNG
to God a ransom for him:
TGARFH


 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it
FTROTSIPAI
ceaseth for ever:)
CFE


 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
THSSLFEANSC


 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
FHSTWMDLTFAT
brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
BPPALTWTO


 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue
TITITTHSC
for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their
FEATDPTAGTCT
lands after their own names.
LATON


 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
NMBIHANHILT
beasts that perish.
BTP


 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
TTWITFYTPA
their sayings. Selah.
TSS


 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
LSTALITGDSFO
them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and
TATUSHDOTITMA
their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
TBSCITGFTD


 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
BGWRMSFTPOTGF
he shall receive me. Selah.
HSRMS


 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
BNTAWOIMRWTGO
his house is increased;
HHII


 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory
FWHDHSCNAHG
shall not descend after him.
SNDAH


 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will
TWHLHBHSAMW
praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
PTWTDWTT


 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall
HSGTTGOHFTS
never see light.
NSL


 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
MTIIHAUNILT
beasts that perish.
BTP


 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
TMGETLHSACT
earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
EFTROTSUTGDT


 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
OOZTPOBGHS


 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
OGSCASNKSAFS
devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
DBHAISBVTRAH


 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
HSCTTHFAATTE
that he may judge his people.
THMJHP


 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
GMSTUMTTHMA
covenant with me by sacrifice.
CWMBS


 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
ATHSDHRFGI
judge himself. Selah.
JHS


 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
HOMPAIWSOIAIW
testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.
TATIAGETG


 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
IWNRTFTSOTB
offerings, to have been continually before me.
OTHBCBM


 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
IWTNBOOTHNHGOO
thy folds.
TF


 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
FEBOTFIMATCUA
thousand hills.
TH


 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts
IKATFOTMATWB
of the field are mine.
OTFAM


 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
IIWHIWNTTFTWI
mine, and the fulness thereof.
MATFT


 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
WIETFOBODTBOG


 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
OUGTAPTVUTM
High:
H


 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
ACUMITDOTIWDT
and thou shalt glorify me.
ATSGM


 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
BUTWGSWHTTDT
declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
DMSOTTSTMCIT
mouth?
M


 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
STHIACMWB
thee.
T


 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him,
WTSATTTCWH
and hast been partaker with adulterers.
AHBPWA


 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth
TGTMTEATTF
deceit.
D


 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou
TSASATBT
slanderest thine own mother's son.
STOMS


 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
TTHTDAIKST
thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will
TTIWASAOATBIW
reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
RTASTIOBTE


 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
NCTYTFGLITYI
pieces, and there be none to deliver.
PATBNTD


 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that
WOPGMATHT
ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
OHCAWISTSOG


 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
HMUMOGATTL
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
AUTMOTTMBOM
transgressions.
T


 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
WMTFMIACMFM
sin.
S


 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever
FIAMTAMSIE
before me.
BM


 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil
ATTOHISADTE
in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and
ITSTTMBJWTSA
be clear when thou judgest.
BCWTJ


 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
BIWSIIAISDMM
conceive me.
CM


 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
BTDTITIPAIT
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
HPTSMMTKW


 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
PMWHAISBCWMAI
shall be whiter than snow.
SBWTS


 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
MMTHJAGTTBWT
hast broken may rejoice.
HBMR


 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine
HTFFMSABOAM
iniquities.
I


 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
CIMACHOGARARS
within me.
WM


 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
CMNAFTPATNTH
spirit from me.
SFM


 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
RUMTJOTSAUMW
thy free spirit.
TFS


 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall
TWITTTWASS
be converted unto thee.
BCUT


 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
DMFBOGTGOM
salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
SAMTSSAOTR


 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
OLOTMLAMMSSFT
praise.
P


 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
FTDNSEWIGIT
delightest not in burnt offering.
DNIBO


 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
TSOGAABSABAA
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
CHOGTWND


 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
DGITGPUZBTTW
of Jerusalem.
OJ


 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
TSTBPWTSO
righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall
RWBOAWBOTS
they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
TOBUTA


 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
WBTTIMOMMT
goodness of God endureth continually.
GOGEC


 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
TTDMLASRW
deceitfully.
D


 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
TLEMTGALRTT
speak righteousness. Selah.
SRS


 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
TLADWOTDT


 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
GSLDTFEHSTT
away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of
AAPTOOTDPARTOO
the land of the living. Selah.
TLOTLS


 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
TRASSAFASLA
him:
H


 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
LTITMTMNGHSB
trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
TITAOHRASHIH
wickedness.
W


 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I
BIALAGOTITHOGI
trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
TITMOGFEAE


 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and
IWPTFEBTHDIA
I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
IWWOTNFIIGBTS


 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt
TFHSIHHTINGC
are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth
ATAHDAITINTD
good.
G


 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
GLDFHUTCOMTS
if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
ITWATDUTDSG


 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
EOOTIGBTAAB
filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
FTINTDGNNO


 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
HTWOINKWEUM
people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
PATEBTHNCUG


 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God
TWTIGFWNFWFG
hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast
HSTBOHTEATTH
put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
PTTSBGHDT


 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
OTTSOIWCOOZW
God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and
GBBTCOHPJSRA
Israel shall be glad.
ISBG


 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
SMOGBTNAJMBTS


 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
HMPOGGETTWOMM


 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
FSARUAMAOS
after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
AMSTHNSGBTS


 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that
BGIMHTLIWTT
uphold my soul.
UMS


 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
HSREUMECTOIT
truth.
T


 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
IWFSUTIWPTNO
LORD; for it is good.
LFIIG


 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye
FHHDMOOATAME
hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
HSHDUME


 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
GETMPOGAHNTFM
supplication.
S


 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and
AUMAHMIMIMCA
make a noise;
MAN


 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
BOTVOTEBOTO
of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate
OTWFTCIUMAIWTH
me.
M


 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
MHISPWMATTOD
are fallen upon me.
AFUM


 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
FATACUMAHH
overwhelmed me.
OM


 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would
AISOTIHWLADFTW
I fly away, and be at rest.
IFAABAR


 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the
LTWIWFOARIT
wilderness. Selah.
WS


 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
IWHMEFTWSAT


 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
DOLADTTFIHS
violence and strife in the city.
VASITC


 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
DANTGAIUTWT
mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
MAASAITMOI


 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
WIITMTDAGD
not from her streets.
NFHS


 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could
FIWNAETRMTIC
have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
HBINWIHTHMTDMH
against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
AMTIWHHMFH


 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
BIWTAMMEMGAM
acquaintance.
A


 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
WTSCTAWUTHO
God in company.
GIC


 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
LDSUTALTGDQI
hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
HFWIITDAAT


 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
AFMIWCUGATLSSM


 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry
EAMAANWIPAC
aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
AAHSHMV


 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
HHDMSIPFTBTW
against me: for there were many with me.
AMFTWMWM


 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of
GSHAATEHTAO
old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
OSBTHNCTTFNG


 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
HHPFHHASABAPW
him: he hath broken his covenant.
HHHBHC


 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war
TWOHMWSTBBW
was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn
WIHHHWWSTOYWTD
swords.
S


 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
CTBUTLAHSSTH
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
SNSTRTBM


 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
BTOGSBTDITPO
destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
DBADMSNLOHT
days; but I will trust in thee.
DBIWTIT


 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
BMUMOGFMWSMUH
fighting daily oppresseth me.

 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many
MEWDSMUFTBM
that fight against me, O thou most High.

 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
IGIWPHWIGIHPMTI
will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
WNFWFCDUM


 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are
EDTWMWATTA
against me for evil.
AMFE


 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
TGTTTHTT
mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
MMSWTWFMS


 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
STEBIITACDT
people, O God.
POG


 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy
TTMWPTMTIT
bottle: are they not in thy book?

this I know; for God is for me.

IGWIPHWITLWIPH
word.

 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man
IGHIPMTIWNBAWM
can do unto me.
CDUM


 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto
TVAUMOGIWRPU
thee.

 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
FTHDMSFDWNT
deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light
DMFFFTIMWBGITL
of the living?
OTL


 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
BMUMOGBMUMFMS
trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my

IWCUGMHUGTPA
things for me.

his truth.

 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are
MSIALAILEATTA
set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
SOFETSOMWTASAA
and their tongue a sharp sword.
ATTASS


 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
BTEOGATHLTGB
above all the earth.

 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed
THPANFMSMSIB
down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
DTHDAPBMITMWTA
fallen themselves. Selah.

 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
MHIFOGMHIFIWSA
give praise.

AUMGAPAHIMW
awake early.

the clouds.

 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
BTEOGATHLTGB
above all the earth.
AATE


 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye
DYISROCDY
judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
JUOYSOM


 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
YIHYWWYWTVO
your hands in the earth.
YHITE


 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as
TWAEFTWTGAA
soon as they be born, speaking lies.
SATBBSL


 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
TPILTPOASTAL
the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
TDATSHE


 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
WWNHTTVOCC
never so wisely.
NSW


 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the
BTTOGITMBOT
great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
GTOTYLOL


 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
LTMAAWWRCWH
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
BHBTSHALTBACIP


 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
AASWMLEOOTPA
like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
LTUBOAWTTMNSTS


 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them
BYPCFTTHSTT
away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
STAMSSVTIARFT
righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
RVHIAGTJITE


 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
DMFMEOMGDMFT
that rise up against me.

 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from

bloody men.

 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are
FLTLIWFMSTMA
gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
GAMNFMTNFMSOL


 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
TRAPTWMFAT
help me, and behold.

 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel,
TTOLGOHTGOI
awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
ATVATHBNMTAW
transgressors. Selah.

 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
TRAETMANLADAG
round about the city.
RATC


 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
BTBOWTMSAIT
lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
LFWSTDH


 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all
BTOLSLATTSHA
the heathen in derision.
THID


 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
BOHSWIWUTFGIM
defence.

 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see
TGOMMSPMGSLMS
my desire upon mine enemies.
MDUME


 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
STNLMPFSTBT
power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
PABTDOLOS


 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
FTSOTMATWOTLL
them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they
TEBTITPAFCALWT
speak.

 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be:
CTIWCTTTMNB
and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.
ALTKTGRIJUTEOTE
Selah.

 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise
AAELTRALTMAN
like a dog, and go round about the city.

 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
LTWUADFMAGITB
not satisfied.

mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the

day of my trouble.

 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou

HBDOTTTUA


 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it:

 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will
GHSIHHIWRIW
divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
DSAMOTVOS


 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the

strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
SOMHJIML


 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
MIMWOEWICOMS
Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
PTTBOM


 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me
WWBMITSCWWLM
into Edom?
IE


 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
WNTOGWHCUOATO
God, which didst not go out with our armies?
GWDNGOWOA


 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

the enemy.

salvation.

 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I
HOIMRAMSHIMDI

SNBGM


 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
HLWYIMAAMYSB
slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering
SAOYAABWSYBAAAT
fence.

 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
TOCTCHDFHET
delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.
DILTBWTMBTCI
Selah.
S


 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
MSWTOUGFMEIF
him.
H


 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I
HOIMRAMSHIMDI

SNBM


 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my
IGIMSAMGTROM
strength, and my refuge, is in God.
SAMRIIG


 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
TIHAATYPPOYH
before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
BHGIARFUS


 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
SMOLDAVAMOHD
are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than
AALTBLITBTAALT
vanity.
V


 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
TNIOABNVIRI
riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
RISNYHUT


 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
GHSOTHIHTTP
belongeth unto God.
BUG


 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest
AUTOLBMFTR
to every man according to his work.
TEMATHW


 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
OGTAMGEWISTMS
thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
TFTMFLFTIADAT
land, where no water is;
LWNWI


 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in
TSTPATGSAIHSTI
the sanctuary.
TS


 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips
BTLIBTLML
shall praise thee.
SPT


 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
TWIBTWILIWLUMH
in thy name.
ITN


 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and
MSSBSAWMAFA
my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
MMSPTWJL


 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in
WIRTUMBAMOTI
the night watches.
TNW


 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of
BTHBMHTITSO
thy wings will I rejoice.
TWWIR


 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
MSFHATTRHU
me.
M


 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into
BTTSMSTDISGI
the lower parts of the earth.
TLPOTE


 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
TSFBTSTSBAPF
foxes.
F


 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth
BTKSRIGEOTS
by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be
BHSGBTMOTTSLSB
stopped.
S


 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from
HMVOGIMPPMLF
fear of the enemy.
FOTE


 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
HMFTSCOTWFT
insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
IOTWOI


 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
WWTTLASABTBT
shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
STAEBW


 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do
TTMSISATPSD
they shoot at him, and fear not.
TSAHAFN


 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
TETIAEMTCO
laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
LSPTSWSST


 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent
TSOITAAD
search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is
SBTITOEOOTATHI
deep.
D


 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall
BGSSATWAASS
they be wounded.
TBW


 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
STSMTOTTFUT
all that see them shall flee away.
ATSTSFA


 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God;
AAMSFASDTWOG
for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
FTSWCOHD


 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
TRSBGITLASTI
him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
PWFTOGISAUTS
the vow be performed.

 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
OTTHPUTSAFC


 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions,
IPAMAFOT
thou shalt purge them away.
TSPTA


 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to
BITMWTCACT
approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
AUTTHMDITCWSB
satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
SWTGOTHEOTHT


 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O
BTTIRWTAUO
God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the
GOOSWATCOATEOT
earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
EAOTTAAOUTS


 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being
WBHSSFTMB
girded with power:
GWP


 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
WSTNOTSTNOT
waves, and the tumult of the people.
WATTOTP


 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at
TATDITUPAAA
thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
TTTMTOOTMAET
rejoice.
R


 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
TVTEAWITG
enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou
EIWTROGWIFOWT
preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
PTCWTHSPFI


 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest
TWTRTATS
the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest
TFTTMISWSTB
the springing thereof.
TST


 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
TCTYWTGATPD
fatness.
F


 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the
TDUTPOTWAT
little hills rejoice on every side.
LHROES


 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
TPACWFTVAA
covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
COWCTSFJTAS


 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
MAJNUGAYL


 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
SFTHOHNMHPG


 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through
SUGHTATITWT
the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto
TGOTPSTESTU
thee.
T


 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
ATESWTASSUT
they shall sing to thy name. Selah.
TSSTTNS


 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
CASTWOGHITIHD
toward the children of men.
TTCOM


 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
HTTSIDLTWTTF
on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
OFTDWRIH


 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the
HRBHPFEHEBT
nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
NLNTRETS


 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
OBOGYPAMTVOHP
to be heard:
TBH


 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet
WHOSILASNOF
to be moved.
TBM


 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as
FTOGHPUTHTUA
silver is tried.
SIT


 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
TBUITNTLAU
our loins.
OL


 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
THCMTROOHWWT
fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
FATWBTBUOIAW
place.
P


 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay
IWGITHWBOIWP
thee my vows,
TMV


 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
WMLHUAMMHSWI
was in trouble.
WIT


 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with
IWOUTBSOFW
the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
TIORIWOBWGS


 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
CAHAYTFGAIWDW
he hath done for my soul.
HHDFMS


 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
ICUHWMMAHWEWM
tongue.
T


 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
IIRIIMHTLWNHM


 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice
BVGHHMHHATTV
of my prayer.
OMP


 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor
BBGWHNTAMPN
his mercy from me.
HMFM


 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
GBMUUABUACHFT
shine upon us; Selah.
SUUS


 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health
TTWMBKUETSH
among all nations.
AAN


 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
LTPPTOGLATPP
thee.

 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
OLTNBGASFJFTS
judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
JTPRAGTNUES

LTPPTOGLATPP
thee.

 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
GSBUAATEOTESF
him.

 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
LGALHEBSLTA
that hate him flee before him.
THHFBH


 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
ASIDASDTAAWM
before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
BTFSLTWPATPOG


 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
BLTRBGLTRBG
yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
YLTER


 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that
SUGSPTHNEHT
rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
RUTHBHNJARBH


 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is
AFOTFAAJOTWI
God in his holy habitation.
GIHHH


 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
GSTSIFHBOT
which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
WABWCBTRDIADL


 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
OGWTWFBTPWT
didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
DMTTWS


 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
TESTHADATPO
God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of
GESIWMATPOGTGO
Israel.
I


 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
TOGDSAPRWTD
confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
CTIWIWW


 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
TCHDTTOGH
prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
KOADFAASTTAH
divided the spoil.

wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as
WTASKIIIWWA
snow in Salmon.

 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as
THOGIATHOBAHHA
the hill of Bashan.
THOB


 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
WLYYHHTITHWG
desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.
DTDIYTLWDIIFE


 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
TCOGATTETO
angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
ATLIATAISITHP


 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
THAOHTHLCC
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that
THRGFMYFTRAT
the LORD God might dwell among them.
TLGMDAT


 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits,
BBTLWDLUWB
even the God of our salvation. Selah.
ETGOOSS


 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
HTIOGITGOSAUGT
Lord belong the issues from death.
LBTIFD


 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
BGSWTHOHEATH
scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
SOSAOAGOSIHT


 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring
TLSIWBAFBIWB
my people again from the depths of the sea:
MPAFTDOTS


 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies,
TTFMBDITBOTE
and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
ATTOTDITS


 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
THSTGOGETGOMG
my King, in the sanctuary.
MKITS


 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
TSWBTPOIF
after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
AATWTDPWT


 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
BYGITCETLFT
fountain of Israel.
FOI


 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
TILBWTRTPO
Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of

Naphtali.

 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring

 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
RTCOSTMOTB

pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.

 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
SMOGFTWACIUMS


 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
ISIDMWTINSIAC
into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
IDWWTFOM


 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
IAWOMCMTIDMEF
while I wait for my God.
WIWFMG


 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
TTHMWACAMTTHO
mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully,
MHTTWDMBMEW
are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
AMTIRTWITNA


 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
OGTKMFAMSANH

LNTTWOTOLGOHB
ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my
AFMSLNTTSTBCFM
sake, O God of Israel.

 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath
BFTSIHBRSH
covered my face.

 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto
IABASUMBAAAU
my mother's children.

 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the

reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
ROTTRTAFUM


 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
WIWACMSWFTWT
my reproach.

me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
MATTMOTTM


 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
AHNTFFTSFIAIT
hear me speedily.
HMS


 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
DNUMSARIDMBO
mine enemies.
ME


 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
THKMRAMSAMD
mine adversaries are all before thee.
MAAABT


 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:
RHBMHAIAFOH
and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
AILFSTTPBTWNAF
comforters, but I found none.
CBIFN


 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they
TGMAGFMMAIMTT
gave me vinegar to drink.
GMVTD


 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
LTTBASBTATW
should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
SHBFTWLIBAT


 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make
LTEBDTTSNAM
their loins continually to shake.
TLCTS


 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
POTIUTALTW
anger take hold of them.
ATHOT


 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in
LTHBDALNDI
their tents.
TT


 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
FTPHWTHSATT
to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
TTGOTWTHW


 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
AIUTIALTNCI
thy righteousness.
TR


 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not
LTBBOOTBOTLAN
be written with the righteous.
BWWTR


 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set
BIAPASLTSOGS
me up on high.
MUOH


 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
IWPTNOGWASAWM
him with thanksgiving.
HWT


 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
TASPTLBTAOOB
that hath horns and hoofs.
THHAH


 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
THSSTABGAYHS
live that seek God.
LTSG


 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
FTLHTPADNH
prisoners.
P


 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every
LTHAEPHTSAE
thing that moveth therein.
TTMT


 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
FGWSZAWBTCOJ
that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
TTMDTAHIIP


 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they
TSAOHSSIIAT
that love his name shall dwell therein.
TLHNSDT


 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
MHOGTDMMHTHMO
LORD.
L




 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
LTBAACTSAMS
let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
LTBTBAPTCTDMH


 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that
LTBTBFAROTST
say, Aha, aha.
SAA


 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:
LATTSTRABGIT
and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
ALSALTSSCLGB
magnified.
M


 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
BIAPANMHUMOGTA
my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
MHAMDOLMNT


 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
ITOLDIPMTLMNBPT
confusion.
C


 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
DMITRACMTE
incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
ITEUMASM


 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
BTMSHWIMC
resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock
RTHGCTSMFTAMR
and my fortress.
AMF


 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
DMOMGOOTHOTWOO
the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
THOTUACM


 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
FTAMHOLGTAMTFM
youth.
Y


 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he
BTHIBHUFTWTAH
that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually
TTMOOMMBMPSBC
of thee.
OT


 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
IAAAWUMBTAMSR


 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour
LMMBFWTPAWTH
all the day.
ATD


 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when
CMNOITTOOAFMNW
my strength faileth.
MSF


 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait
FMESAMATTLW
for my soul take counsel together,
FMSTCT


 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
SGHFHPATHF
there is none to deliver him.
TINTDH


 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
OGBNFFMOMGMHFMH


 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to
LTBCACTAAT
my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
MSLTBCWRADTSM
hurt.
H


 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more
BIWHCAWYPTM
and more.
AM


 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy
MMSSFTRAT
salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
SATDFIKNTNT


 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make
IWGITSOTLGIWM
mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
MOTREOTO


 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have
OGTHTMFMYAHH
I declared thy wondrous works.
IDTWW


 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me
NAWIAOAGOGFM
not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
NUIHSTSUTGAT
power to every one that is to come.
PTEOTITC


 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
TRAOGIVHWHD
great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
GTOGWILUT


 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
TWHSMGASTS
quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
QMAASBMUAFTDOT
earth.
E


 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
TSIMGACMOE
side.
S


 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
IWAPTWTPETTO
my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
MGUTWISWTHOTHOOI


 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
MLSGRWISUTAM
soul, which thou hast redeemed.
SWTHR


 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
MTASTOTRATD
long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that
LFTACFTABUST
seek my hurt.
SMH


 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness
GTKTJOGATR
unto the king's son.
UTKS


 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
HSJTPWRATP
with judgment.
WJ


 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the
TMSBPTTPAT
little hills, by righteousness.
LHBR


 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
HSJTPOTPHSST
children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
COTNASBIPTO


 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
TSFTALATSAME
throughout all generations.
TAG


 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
HSCDLRUTMGAS
that water the earth.
TWTE


 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
IHDSTRFAAO
peace so long as the moon endureth.
PSLATME


 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
HSHDAFSTSAFT
river unto the ends of the earth.
RUTEOTE


 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
TTDITWSBBHA
his enemies shall lick the dust.
HESLTD


 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
TKOTAOTISBP
the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
TKOSASSOG


 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
YAKSFDBHANS
serve him.
SH


 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor
FHSDTNWHCTP
also, and him that hath no helper.
AAHTHNH


 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls
HSSTPANASSTS
of the needy.
OTN


 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
HSRTSFDAVA
precious shall their blood be in his sight.
PSTBBIHS


 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
AHSLATHSBGOTGO
Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall
SPASBMFHCADS
he be praised.
HBP


 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top
TSBAHOCITEUTT
of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they
OTMTFTSSLLAT
of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
OTCSFLGOTE


 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued
HNSEFEHNSBC
as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall
ALATSAMSBBIHANS
call him blessed.
CHB


 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
BBTLGTGOIWOD
wondrous things.
WT


 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
ABBHGNFEALTW
earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
EBFWHGAAA


 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
TPODTSOJAE


 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
TGIGTIETSAAOAC
heart.
H


 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
BAFMMFWAGMSHW
nigh slipped.
NS


 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity
FIWEATFWISTP
of the wicked.
OTW


 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
FTANBITDBTSI
firm.
F


 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they
TANITAOMNAT
plagued like other men.
PLOM


 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
TPCTAAACV
covereth them as a garment.
CTAAG


 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
TESOWFTHMTH
could wish.
CW


 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
TACASWCO
they speak loftily.
TSL


 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
TSTMATHATT
walketh through the earth.
WTTE


 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
THPRHAWOAFC
are wrung out to them.
AWOTT


 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in
ATSHDGKAITKI
the most High?
TMH


 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world;
BTATUWPITW
they increase in riches.
TIIR


 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
VIHCMHIVAWMH
in innocency.
II


 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened
FATDLHIBPAC
every morning.
EM


 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
IISIWSTBISOA
the generation of thy children.
TGOTC


 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
WITTKTIWTPFM


 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
UIWITSOGTUI
their end.
TE


 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
STDSTISPTC
them down into destruction.
TDID


 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they
HATBIDAIAMT
are utterly consumed with terrors.
AUCWT


 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
AADWOASOLWTA
thou shalt despise their image.
TSDTI


 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
TMHWGAIWPIMR


 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before
SFWIAIIWAABB
thee.
T


 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
NIACWTTHHM
by my right hand.
BMRH


 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive
TSGMWTCAAR
me to glory.
MTG


 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
WHIIHBTATINUE
that I desire beside thee.
TIDBT


 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
MFAMHFBGITSOM
heart, and my portion for ever.
HAMPFE


 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
FLTTAFFTSPTH
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
DATTGAWFT


 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my
BIIGFMTDNTGIHPM
trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
TITLGTIMDATW


 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
OGWHTCUOFEWDT
anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
ASATSOTP


 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
RTCWTHPOO
the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount
TROTIWTHRTM
Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
ZWTHD


 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all
LUTFUTPDEA
that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
TTEHDWITS


 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they
TERITMOTCT
set up their ensigns for signs.
SUTEFS


 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
AMWFAAHHLUAUT
thick trees.
TT


 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
BNTBDTCWTAOW
axes and hammers.
AAH


 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
THCFITSTHDB
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
CDTDPOTNTTG


 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together:
TSITHLUDTT
they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
THBUATSOGITL


 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither
WSNOSTINMAPN
is there among us any that knoweth how long.
ITAUATKHL


 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the
OGHLSTARST
enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
EBTNFE


 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
WWTTHETRHPI
out of thy bosom.
OOTB


 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
FGIMKOOWSITMO
the earth.
TE


 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
TDDTSBTSTBT
heads of the dragons in the waters.
HOTDITW


 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest
TBTHOLIPAG
him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
HTBMTTPITW


 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst
TDCTFATFTD
up mighty rivers.
UMR


 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast
TDITTNAITTH
prepared the light and the sun.
PTLATS


 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
THSATBOTETHM
summer and winter.
SAW


 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
RTTTEHROLA
that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
TTFPHBTN


 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude
ODNTSOTTUTM
of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
OTWFNTCOTPFE


 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
HRUTCFTDPOT
earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
EAFOTHOC


 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and
OLNTORALTPA
needy praise thy name.
NPTN


 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the
AOGPTOCRHT
foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
FMRTD


 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
FNTVOTETTOT
that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
TRUATIC


 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
UTOGDWGTUTDWG
thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
TFTTNINTWWD


 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge
WISRTCIWJ
uprightly.
U


 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
TEAATITADI
bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
BUTPOIS


 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the
ISUTFDNFATT
wicked, Lift not up the horn:
WLNUTH


 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
LNUYHOHSNWASN


 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the
FPCNFTENFT
west, nor from the south.
WNFTS


 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
BGITJHPDOASU
another.
A


 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
FITHOTLTIACATWI
red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the
RIIFOMAHPOOTSBT
dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and
DTATWOTESWTOA
drink them.
DT


 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God
BIWDFEIWSPTTG
of Jacob.
OJ


 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the
ATHOTWAWICOBT
horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
HOTRSBE


 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
IJIGKHNIGII


 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
ISAIHTAHDPI
Zion.
Z


 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
TBHTAOTBTSAT
sword, and the battle. Selah.
SATBS


 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
TAMGAETTMO
prey.
P


 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep:
TSASTHSTS
and none of the men of might have found their hands.
ANOTMOMHFTH


 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse
ATROGOJBTCAH
are cast into a dead sleep.
ACIADS


 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
TETATBFAWMSIT
sight when once thou art angry?
SWOTAA


 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
TDCJTBHFHTE
feared, and was still,
FAWS


 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the
WGATJTSATMOT
earth. Selah.
ES


 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
STWOMSPTTRO
wrath shalt thou restrain.
WSTR


 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
VAPUTLYGLATBR
about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
AHBPUHTOTBF


 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to
HSCOTSOPHITT
the kings of the earth.
TKOTE


 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
ICUGWMVEUGWMV
and he gave ear unto me.
AHGEUM


 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in
ITDOMTISTLMSRI
the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
TNACNMSRTBC


 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
IRGAWTICAM
spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
SWOS


 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I
THMEWIASTTI
cannot speak.
CS


 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient
IHCTDOOTYOA
times.
T


 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
ICTRMSITNICW
mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
MOHAMSMDS


 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable
WTLCOFEAWHBF
no more?
NM


 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
IHMCGFEDHPFF
evermore?
E


 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
HGFTBGHHIASU
his tender mercies? Selah.
HTMS


 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
AISTIMIBIWRT
years of the right hand of the most High.
YOTRHOTMH


 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will
IWRTWOTLSIW
remember thy wonders of old.
RTWOO


 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy
IWMAOATWATOT
doings.
D


 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God
TWOGIITSWISGAG
as our God?
AOG


 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
TATGTDWTHDT
strength among the people.
SATP


 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
THWTARTPTSO
Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
JAJS


 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
TWSTOGTWSTTW
afraid: the depths also were troubled.
ATDAWT


 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound:
TCPOWTSSOAS
thine arrows also went abroad.
TAAWA


 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
TVOTTWITHTL
lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
LTWTETAS


 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
TWIITSATPITGWA
thy footsteps are not known.
TFANK


 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses
TLTPLAFBTHOM
and Aaron.
AA


 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
GEOMPTMLIYETT
words of my mouth.
WOMM


 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
IWOMMIAPIWUDS
of old:
OO


 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
WWHHAKAOFHTU


 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
WWNHTFTCSTT
generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his
GTCTPOTLAHSAH
wonderful works that he hath done.
WWTHHD


 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
FHEATIJAAAL
in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them
IIWHCOFTTSMT
known to their children:
KTTC


 That the generation to come might know them, even the
TTGTCMKTET
children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
CWSBBWSAADTT
their children:
TC


 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
TTMSTHIGANFT
works of God, but keep his commandments:
WOGBKHC


 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
AMNBATFASAR
generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
GAGTSNTHAAW
spirit was not stedfast with God.
SWNSWG


 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
TCOEBAACB
turned back in the day of battle.
TBITDOB


 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in
TKNTCOGARTWI
his law;
HL


 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed
AFHWAHWTHHS
them.
T


 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in
MTDHITSOTFI
the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
TLOEITFOZ


 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
HDTSACTTPTAH
made the waters to stand as an heap.
MTWTSAAH


 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
ITDAHLTWACAAT
night with a light of fire.
NWALOF


 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
HCTRITWAGTDA
out of the great depths.
OOTGD


 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters
HBSAOOTRACW
to run down like rivers.
TRDLR


 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
ATSYMAHBPTM
High in the wilderness.
HITW


 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
ATTGITHBAMFT
lust.
L


 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
YTSAGTSCGFA
table in the wilderness?
TITW


 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and
BHSTRTTWGOA
the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh
TSOCHGBACHPF
for his people?
FHP


 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
TTLHTAWWSAFW
kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
KAJAAACUAI


 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
BTBNIGATNIH
salvation:
S


 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened
THHCTCFAAO
the doors of heaven,
TDOH


 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given
AHRDMUTTEAHG
them of the corn of heaven.
TOTCOH


 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
MDEAFHSTMTTF


 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his
HCAEWTBITHABH
power he brought in the south wind.
PHBITSW


 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
HRFAUTADAFF
like as the sand of the sea:
LATSOTS


 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
AHLIFITMOTCRA
their habitations.
TH


 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them
STDEAWWFFHGT
their own desire;
TOD


 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their
TWNEFTLBWT
meat was yet in their mouths,
MWYITM


 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of
TWOGCUTASTFO
them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
TASDTCMOI


 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
FATTSSABNFH
wondrous works.
WW


 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their
TTDDHCIVAT
years in trouble.
YIT


 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned
WHSTTTSHATR
and enquired early after God.
AEEAG


 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high
ATRTGWTRATH
God their redeemer.
GTR


 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
NTDFHWTMAT
lied unto him with their tongues.
LUHWTT


 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
FTHWNRWHNWT
stedfast in his covenant.
SIHC


 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity,
BHBFOCFTI
and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and
ADTNYMATTHHAAA
did not stir up all his wrath.
DNSUAHW


 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
FHRTTWBFAWT
passeth away, and cometh not again.
PAACNA


 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve
HODTPHITWAG
him in the desert!
HITD


 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
YTTBATGALTH
One of Israel.
OOI


 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
TRNHHNTDWHD
them from the enemy.
TFTE


 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in
HHHWHSIEAHWI
the field of Zoan.
TFOZ


 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods,
AHTTRIBATF
that they could not drink.
TTCND


 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured
HSDSOFATWD
them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
TAFWDT


 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
HGATIUTCAT
labour unto the locust.
LUTL


 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
HDTVWHATST
with frost.
WF


 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks
HGUTCATTHATF
to hot thunderbolts.
THT


 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
HCUTTFOHAWA
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
IATBSEAAT


 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
HMAWTHAHSNTSF
death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
DBGTLOTTP


 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
ASATFIETCOT
strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
SITTOH


 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
BMHOPTGFLSAG
them in the wilderness like a flock.
TITWLAF


 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
AHLTOSSTTFNBT
sea overwhelmed their enemies.
SOTE


 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
AHBTTTBOHSET
this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
TMWHRHHP


 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them
HCOTHABTADT
an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
AIBLAMTTOITDIT
tents.
T


 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept
YTTAPTMHGAK
not his testimonies:
NHT


 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
BTBADULTF
they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
TWTALADB


 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
FTPHTAWTHPA
moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
MHTJWTGI


 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
WGHTHWWAGA
Israel:
I


 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which
STHFTTOSTTW
he placed among men;
HPAM


 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory
ADHSICAHG
into the enemy's hand.
ITEH


 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
HGHPOAUTSAWW
with his inheritance.
WHI


 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were
TFCTYMATMW
not given to marriage.
NGTM


 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
TPFBTSATWMN
lamentation.
L


 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
TTLAAOOOSALAM
man that shouteth by reason of wine.
MTSBROW


 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to
AHSHEITHPHPTT
a perpetual reproach.
APR


 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
MHRTTOJACN
the tribe of Ephraim:
TTOE


 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
BCTTOJTMZWHL


 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
AHBHSLHPLTE
which he hath established for ever.
WHHEFE


 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
HCDAHSATHFT
sheepfolds:
S


 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
FFTEGWYHBHT
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
FJHPAIHI


 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
SHFTATTIOHHA
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
GTBTSOHH


 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
OGTHACITITH
temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
THTDTHLJOH


 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
TDBOTSHTGTBM
unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts
UTFOTHTFOTSUTB
of the earth.
OTE


 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
TBHTSLWRAJ
and there was none to bury them.
ATWNTBT


 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
WABARTONASA
derision to them that are round about us.
DTTTARAU


 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
HLLWTBAFEST
jealousy burn like fire?
JBLF


 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known
POTWUTHTHNK
thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
TAUTKTHNCUTN


 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
FTHDJALWHD
place.
P


 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
ORNAUFILTT
mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
MSPUFWABVL


 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
HUOGOOSFTGOTN
and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
ADUAPAOSFTNS


 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let
WSTHSWITGL
him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the
HBKATHIOSBTROT
blood of thy servants which is shed.
BOTSWIS


 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according
LTSOTPCBTA
to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to
TTGOTPPTTTAAT
die;
D


 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
ARUONSITB
their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
TRWTHRTOL


 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
SWTPASOTPWGT
thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
TFEWWSFTPTAG


 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph
GEOSOITTLJ
like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
LAFTTDBTCSF


 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy
BEABAMSUT
strength, and come and save us.
SACASU


 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
TUAOGACTFTSAW
shall be saved.
SBS


 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
OLGOHHLWTBAAT
prayer of thy people?
POTP


 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
TFTWTBOTAGT
tears to drink in great measure.
TTDIGM


 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
TMUASUONAOE
laugh among themselves.
LAT


 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
TUAOGOHACTFTS
and we shall be saved.
AWSBS


 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out
THBAVOOETHCO
the heathen, and planted it.
THAPI


 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
TPRBIADCITT
deep root, and it filled the land.
DRAIFTL


 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
THWCWTSOIATB
thereof were like the goodly cedars.
TWLTGC


 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
SSOHBUTSAHBU
the river.
TR


 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
WHTTBDHHSTAT
which pass by the way do pluck her?
WPBTWDPH


 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast
TBOOTWDWIATWB
of the field doth devour it.
OTFDDI


 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
RWBTOGOHLDF
heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
HABAVTV


 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
ATVWTRHHPAT
branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
BTTMSFT


 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
IIBWFIICDTPAT
rebuke of thy countenance.
ROTC


 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
LTHBUTMOTRHUTS
of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
OMWTMSFT


 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will
SWNWGBFTQUAWW
call upon thy name.
CUTN


 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
TUAOLGOHCTFTS
and we shall be saved.
AWSBS


 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto
SAUGOSMAJNU
the God of Jacob.
TGOJ


 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant
TAPABHTTTP
harp with the psaltery.
HWTP


 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed,
BUTTITNMITTA
on our solemn feast day.
OOSFD


 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
FTWASFIAALOTGO
Jacob.
J


 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
THOIJFATWHWO
through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood
TTLOEWIHALTIU
not.
N


 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
IRHSFTBHHW
delivered from the pots.
DFTP


 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
TCITAIDTIA
thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of
TITSPOTIPTATWO
Meribah. Selah.
MS


 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel,
HOMPAIWTUTOI
if thou wilt hearken unto me;
ITWHUM


 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
TSNSGBITNST
worship any strange god.
WASG


 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
IATLTGWBTOOTLO
Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
EOTMWAIWFI


 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel
BMPWNHTMVAI
would none of me.
WNOM


 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they
SIGTUUTOHLAT
walked in their own counsels.
WITOC


 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had
OTMPHHUMAIH
walked in my ways!
WIMW


 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
ISSHSTEATMH
against their adversaries.
ATA


 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
THOTLSHSTU
him: but their time should have endured for ever.
HBTTSHEFE


 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat:
HSHFTAWTFOTW
and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
AWHOOTRSIHST


 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
GSITCOTMHJ
among the gods.
ATG


 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of
HLWYJUAATPO
the wicked? Selah.
TWS


 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
DTPAFDJTTA
and needy.
AN


 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
DTPANRTOOTHOT
wicked.
W


 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
TKNNWTUTWOI
darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
DATFOTEAOOC


 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
IHSYAGAAOYACOT
most High.
MH


 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
BYSDLMAFLOOTP


 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
AOGJTEFTSIA
nations.
N


 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
KNTSOGHNTPABN
still, O God.
SOG


 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate
FLTEMATATTH
thee have lifted up the head.
THLUTH


 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
THTCCATPA
consulted against thy hidden ones.
CATHO


 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
THSCALUCTOFBA
nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
NTTNOIMBNMIR


 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
FTHCTWOCTA
confederate against thee:
CAT


 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and
TTOEATIOMA
the Hagarenes;
TH


 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
GAAAATPWT
inhabitants of Tyre;
IOT


 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the
AAIJWTTHHT
children of Lot. Selah.
COLS


 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
DUTAUTMATSAT
Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
JATBOK


 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
WPAETBADFTE


 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
MTNLOALZYAT
princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
PAZAAZ


 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
WSLUTTOTHOGI
possession.
P


 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
OMGMTLAWATSBT
wind.
W


 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
ATFBAWAATFST
mountains on fire;
MOF


 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid
SPTWTTAMTA
with thy storm.
WTS


 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
FTFWSTTMSTNO
LORD.
L


 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them
LTBCATFEYLT
be put to shame, and perish:
BPTSAP


 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH,
TMMKTTWNAIJ
art the most high over all the earth.
ATMHOATE


 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
HAATTOLOH


 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
MSLYEFFTCOT
LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
LMHAMFCOFTLG


 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
YTSHFAHATSAN
for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of
FHWSMLHYETAOLO
hosts, my King, and my God.
HMKAMG


 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
BATTDITHTWBS
praising thee. Selah.
PTS


 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
BITMWSIITIWH
are the ways of them.
ATWOT


 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
WPTTVOBMIAWT
rain also filleth the pools.
RAFTP


 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
TGFSTSEOOTIZ
appeareth before God.
ABG


 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of
OLGOHHMPGEOGO
Jacob. Selah.
JS


 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
BOGOSALUTFOT
anointed.
A


 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
FADITCIBTATIH
rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the
RBADITHOMGTTDIT
tents of wickedness.
TOW


 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give
FTLGIASASTLWG
grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
GAGNGTWHWFTTW
uprightly.
U


 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
OLOHBITMTTIT


 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
LTHBFUTLTH
brought back the captivity of Jacob.
BBTCOJ


 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
THFTIOTPTH
covered all their sin. Selah.
CATSS


 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
THTAATWTHTT
from the fierceness of thine anger.
FTFOTA


 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger
TUOGOOSACTA
toward us to cease.
TUTC


 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out
WTBAWUFEWTDO
thine anger to all generations?
TATAG


 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice
WTNRUATTPMR
in thee?
IT


 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
SUTMOLAGUTS


 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
IWHWGTLWSFHWS
peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again
PUHPATHSBLTNTA
to folly.
TF


 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
SHSINTTFHTG
may dwell in our land.
MDIOL


 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace
MATAMTRAP
have kissed each other.
HKEO


 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
TSSOOTEARS
look down from heaven.
LDFH


 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
YTLSGTWIGAOL
shall yield her increase.
SYHI


 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the
RSGBHASSUIT
way of his steps.
WOHS


 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and
BDTEOLHMFIAPA
needy.

 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
PMSFIAHOTMGST
servant that trusteth in thee.
STTIT


 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
BMUMOLFICUTD


 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
RTSOTSFUTOLDI
lift up my soul.
LUMS


 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and
FTLAGARTFA
plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
PIMUATTCUT


 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
GEOLUMPAATTVO
my supplications.
MS


 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou
ITDOMTIWCUTFT
wilt answer me.
WAM


 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
ATGTINLUTOLN
are there any works like unto thy works.
ATAWLUTW


 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship
ANWTHMSCAW
before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
BTOLASGTN


 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
FTAGADWTTAG

 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
TMTWOLIWWITTUM
heart to fear thy name.
HTFTN


 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
IWPTOLMGWAMHAI
will glorify thy name for evermore.
WGTNFE


 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
FGITMTMATHDM
soul from the lowest hell.
SFTLH


 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
OGTPARAMATAO
violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before
VMHSAMSAHNSTB
them.
T


 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and
BTOLAAGFOCA
gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
GLAPIMAT


 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength
OTUMAHMUMGTS
unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
UTSASTSOTH


 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see
SMATFGTTWHMMS
it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted
IABABTLHHMAC
me.

 His foundation is in the holy mountains.
HFIITHM


 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the
TLLTGOZMTAT
dwellings of Jacob.
DOJ


 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
GTASOTOCOGS


 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know
IWMMORABTTTK
me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
MBPATWETMWBT


 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
AOZISBSTATMWBI
her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
HATHHSEH


 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that
TLSCWHWUTPT
this man was born there. Selah.
TMWBTS


 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
AWTSATPOISB
there: all my springs are in thee.
TAMSAIT


 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night
OLGOMSIHCDAN
before thee:
BT


 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my
LMPCBTITEUM
cry;
C


 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh
FMSIFOTAMLDN
unto the grave.
UTG


 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
IACWTTGDITPIAAA
man that hath no strength:
MTHNS


 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
FATDLTSTLITG
whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
WTRNMATACOFTH


 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
THLMITLPIDIT
deeps.
D


 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me
TWLHUMATHAM
with all thy waves. Selah.
WATWS


 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
THPAMAFFMTH
made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come
MMAAUTIASUAICC
forth.
F


 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have
MEMBROALIH
called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
CDUTIHSOMHUT


 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
WTSWTTDSTDAA
praise thee? Selah.
PTS


 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
STLBDITGOT
faithfulness in destruction?
FID


 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy
STWBKITDAT
righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
RITLOF


 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
BUTHICOLAITMS
my prayer prevent thee.
MPPT


 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
LWCTOMSWHTTF
from me?
FM


 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
IAAARTDFMYUWI
suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
STTIAD


 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
TFWGOMTTHCMO


 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
TCRAMDLWTCM
about together.
AT


 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
LAFHTPFFMAM
acquaintance into darkness.
AID


 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my
IWSOTMOTLFEWM
mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
MWIMKTFTAG


 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
FIHSMSBBUFET
faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
FSTEITVH


 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto
IHMACWMCIHSU
David my servant,
DMS


 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne
TSWIEFEABUTT
to all generations. Selah.
TAGS


 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
ATHSPTWOLT
faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
FAITCOTS


 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who
FWITHCBCUTLW
among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
ATSOTMCBLUTL


 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,
GIGTBFITAOTS
and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
ATBHIROATTAAH


 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
OLGOHWIASLLUTO
to thy faithfulness round about thee?
TTFRAT


 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
TRTROTSWTWT
arise, thou stillest them.
ATST


 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
THBRIPAOTIST
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
HSTEWTSA


 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
THATTEAITAFT
world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
WATFTTHFT


 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
TNATSTHCTTA
Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
HSRITN


 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
THAMASITHAHIT
right hand.
RH


 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
JAJATHOTTM
and truth shall go before thy face.
ATSGBTF


 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
BITPTKTJSTS
walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
WOLITLOTC


 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
ITNSTRATDAIT
righteousness shall they be exalted.
RSTBE


 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
FTATGOTSAITF
our horn shall be exalted.
OHSBE


 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is
FTLIODATHOOII
our king.
OK


 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
TTSIVTTHOASI
have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out
HLHUOTIMIHEOCO
of the people.
OTP


 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
IHFDMSWMHOHI
anointed him:
AH


 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
WWMHSBEMAAS
strengthen him.
SH


 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of
TESNEUHNTSO
wickedness afflict him.
WAH


 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague
AIWBDHFBHFAP
them that hate him.
TTHH


 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in
BMFAMMSBWHAI
my name shall his horn be exalted.
MNSHHBE


 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in
IWSHHAITSAHRHI
the rivers.
TR


 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the
HSCUMTAMFMGAT
rock of my salvation.
ROMS


 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
AIWMHMFHTTKO
the earth.
TE


 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
MMWIKFHFEAMC
shall stand fast with him.
SSFWH


 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
HSAWIMTEFEAHT
as the days of heaven.
ATDOH


 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my
IHCFMLAWNIM
judgments;
J


 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
ITBMSAKNMC


 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and
TWIVTTWTRA
their iniquity with stripes.
TIWS


 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
NMLWINUTF
him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
HNSMFTF


 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is
MCWINBNATTTI
gone out of my lips.
GOOML


 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
OHISBMHTIWNLU
David.
D


 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
HSSEFEAHTATS
before me.
BM


 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
ISBEFEATMAAA
faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
FWIHS


 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth
BTHCOAATHBW
with thine anointed.
WTA


 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
THMVTCOTSTH
profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
PHCBCITTG


 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
THBDAHHTHBH
strong holds to ruin.
SHTR


 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
ATPBTWSHHIARTH
neighbours.
N


 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou
THSUTRHOHAT
hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
HMAHETR


 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not
THATTEOHSAHN
made him to stand in the battle.
MHTSITB


 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down
THMHGTCACHTD
to the ground.
TTG


 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
TDOHYHTSTHC
him with shame. Selah.
HWSS


 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
HLLWTHTFEST
wrath burn like fire?
WBLF


 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
RHSMTIWHTMA
men in vain?
MIV


 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall
WMIHTLASNSDS
he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
HDHSFTHOTGS


 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
LWATFLWT
swarest unto David in thy truth?
SUDITT


 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear
RLTROTSHIDB
in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
IMBTROATMP


 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
WTEHROLW
they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
THRTFOTA


 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
BBTLFEAAA


 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
LTHBODPIAG


 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
BTMWBFOETH
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
FTEATWEFETE
thou art God.
TAG


 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
TTMTDASRY
children of men.
COM


 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when
FATYITSABAYW
it is past, and as a watch in the night.
IIPAAAWITN


 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a
TCTAAWAFTAAA
sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
SITMTALGWGU


 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the
ITMIFAGUIT
evening it is cut down, and withereth.
EIICDAW


 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
FWACBTAABTWAW
troubled.
T


 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
THSOIBTOSSI
the light of thy countenance.
TLOTC


 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
FAODAPAITWWSO
years as a tale that is told.
YAATTIT


 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if
TDOOYATYATAI
by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength
BROSTBFYYITS
labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
LASFIISCOAWFA


 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
WKTPOTAEATT
fear, so is thy wrath.
FSITW


 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
STUTNODTWMAOH
unto wisdom.
UW


 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
ROLHLALIRTC
thy servants.
TS


 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and
OSUEWTMTWMRA
be glad all our days.
BGAOD


 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast
MUGATTDWTH
afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
AUATYWWHSE


 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
LTWAUTSATGU
their children.
TC


 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
ALTBOTLOGBUUA
establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our
ETTWOOHUUYTWOO
hands establish thou it.
HETI


 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
HTDITSPOTMHS
abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
AUTSOTA


 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
IWSOTLHIMRAMFM
God; in him will I trust.
GIHWIT


 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
SHSDTFTSOTF
and from the noisome pestilence.
AFTNP


 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
HSCTWHFAUHW
shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
STTHTSBTSAB


 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for
TSNBAFTTBNNF
the arrow that flieth by day;
TATFBD


 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
NFTPTWIDNFT
destruction that wasteth at noonday.
DTWAN


 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
ATSFATSATTAT
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
RHBISNCNT


 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
OWTESTBASTRO
the wicked.
TW


 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even
BTHMTLWIMRE
the most High, thy habitation;
TMHTH


 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague
TSNEBTNSAP
come nigh thy dwelling.
CNTD


 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee
FHSGHACOTTKT
in all thy ways.
IATW


 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
TSBTUITHLTDT
foot against a stone.
FAAS


 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
TSTUTLAATYLA
the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
TDSTTUF


 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I
BHHSHLUMTWI
deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
DHIWSHOHBHHKMN


 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
HSCUMAIWAHIWBW
him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
HITIWDHAHH


 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my
WLLWISHASHM
salvation.
S


 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
IIAGTTGTUTLATS
PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:
PUTNOMH




 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
TSFTLITMAT
faithfulness every night,
FEN


 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery;
UAIOTSAUTP
upon the harp with a solemn sound.
UTHWASS


 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
FTLHMMGTTWIW
triumph in the works of thy hands.
TITWOTH


 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
OLHGATWATTAV
deep.
D


 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
ABMKNNDAFU
this.
T


 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the
WTWSATGAWAT
workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for
WOIDFIITTSBDF
ever:
E


 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
BTLAMHFE


 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
FLTEOLFLTES
perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
PATWOISBS


 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
BMHSTELTHOAUI
shall be anointed with fresh oil.
SBAWFO


 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
MEASSMDOMEAM
ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
ESHMDOTWTRUAM


 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall
TRSFLTPTHS
grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
GLACIL


 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall
TTBPITHOTLS
flourish in the courts of our God.
FITCOOG


 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
TSSBFFIOATSB
fat and flourishing;
FAF


 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there
TSTTLIUHIMRAT
is no unrighteousness in him.
INUIH


 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
TLRHICWMTLI
clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also
CWSWHHGHTWA
is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
ISTICBM


 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
TTIEOOTAFE


 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
TFHLUOLTFHLU
their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
TVTFLUTW


 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
TLOHIMTTNOMW
yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
YTTMWOTS


 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine
TTAVSHBT
house, O LORD, for ever.
HOLFE


 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
OLGTWVBOGTW
vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
VBST


 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
LUTTJOTERART
the proud.
TP


 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
LHLSTWHLSTW
triumph?
T


 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
HLSTUASHTAAT
workers of iniquity boast themselves?
WOIBT


 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
TBIPTPOLAAT
heritage.
H


 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
TSTWATSAMT
fatherless.
F


 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God
YTSTLSNSNSTG
of Jacob regard it.
OJRI


 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
UYBATPAYFW
will ye be wise?
WYBW


 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed
HTPTESHNHHTF
the eye, shall he not see?
TESHNS


 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he
HTCTHSNHCH
that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
TTMKSNHK


 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
TLKTTOMTTAV


 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and
BITMWTCOLA
teachest him out of thy law;
THOOTL


 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
TTMGHRFTDOA
until the pit be digged for the wicked.
UTPBDFTW


 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
FTLWNCOHPNWH
forsake his inheritance.
FHI


 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
BJSRURAAT
upright in heart shall follow it.
UIHSFI


 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
WWRUFMATEOWW
stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
SUFMATWOI


 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt
UTLHBMHMSHAD
in silence.
IS


 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me
WISMFSTMOLHM
up.
U


 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts
ITMOMTWMTC
delight my soul.
DMS


 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee,
STTOIHFWT
which frameth mischief by a law?
WFMBAL


 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
TGTTATSOT
righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
RACTIB


 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
BTLIMDAMGITROM
refuge.
R


 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall
AHSBUTTOIAS
cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut
CTOITOWYTLOGSC
them off.
TO


 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful
OCLUSUTLLUMAJ
noise to the rock of our salvation.
NTTROOS


 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make

gods.
G


 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength
IHHATDPOTETS
of the hills is his also.
OTHIHA


 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
TSIHAHMIAHHFTD
land.
L


 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
OCLUWABDLUKBT
LORD our maker.
LOM


 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
FHIOGAWATPOHPA
the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
TSOHHTDIYWHHV


 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
HNYHAITPAAIT
day of temptation in the wilderness:
DOTITW


 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
WYFTMPMASMW


 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and
FYLWIGWTGA
said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
SIIAPTDEITHATHN
known my ways:
KMW


 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter
UWISIMWTTSNE
into my rest.

the heavens.

people righteously.

LTHRALTEBGLT
sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with
EHSJTWWRATPW
his truth.

 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude
TLRLTERLTM
of isles be glad thereof.

CADARAHRA
judgment are the habitation of his throne.

 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
AFGBHABUHER
about.

 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and

the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

exalted far above all gods.

his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

upright in heart.

 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
EYTLOGAWAHFF
he is holy.

 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them
MAAAHPASAT

them.

OTTTAISNCTM


 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a

wicked person.

him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.

 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;

the desert.

 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
IWAAAASAUTHT


 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
MERMATDATTAM
against me are sworn against me.
AMASAM

FIHEALBAMMDW
weeping.

 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
BOTIATWFTH
lifted me up, and cast me down.
LMUACMD


 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
MDALASTDAIAW

 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to

favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

kings of the earth thy glory.

HWRTPOTDAND
their prayer.
TP


 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
TSBWFTGTCAT
people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
PWSBCSPTL


 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
FHHLDFTHOHS
from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
FHDTLBTE


 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that
THTGOTPTLTT
are appointed to death;
AATD


 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
TDTNOTLIZAHPI
Jerusalem;
J


 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
WTPAGTATKT
serve the LORD.

 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:

thy years are throughout all generations.
TYATAG


 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
OOHTLTFOTEAT
heavens are the work of thy hands.
HATWOTH


 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
TSPBTSEYAOT
shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and

they shall be changed:

 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
BTATSATYSHNE


 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
TCOTSSCATS
shall be established before thee.

his holy name.

 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
WFATIWHAT
diseases;

WRTLFDWCT
with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
WLATM


 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
WSTMWGTSTTY
is renewed like the eagle's.
IRLTE


 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that
TLERAJFAT
are oppressed.
AO


 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the
HMKHWUMHAUT
children of Israel.
COI


 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
TLIMAGSTAA
plenteous in mercy.
PIM


 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
HWNACNWHKHAF
ever.
E


 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
HHNDWUAOSNRU
according to our iniquities.
ATOI


 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
FATHIHATESGIH
mercy toward them that fear him.
MTTTFH


 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
AFATEIFTWSFHHR
our transgressions from us.
OTFU


 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
LAAFPHCSTLP
them that fear him.
TTFH


 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
FHKOFHRTWAD


 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
AFMHDAAGAAFOTF
so he flourisheth.
SHF


 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
FTWPOIAIIGATP
thereof shall know it no more.
TSKINM


 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
BTMOTLIFETE
upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
UTTFHAHRUC
children;
C


 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
TSAKHCATTTRH
commandments to do them.
CTDT


 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
TLHPHTITHAH
kingdom ruleth over all.

BYTLAYHHYMOH
that do his pleasure.
TDHP


 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
BTLAHWIAPOHD
bless the LORD, O my soul.
BTLOMS


 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very
BTLOMSOLMGTAV
great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
GTACWHAM


 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
WCTWLAWAGW
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
SOTHLAC


 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who
WLTBOHCITWW
maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
MTCHCWWUTWOTW


 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
WMHASHMAFF


 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
WLTFOTETISNB
removed for ever.
RFE


 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the
TCIWTDAWAGT
waters stood above the mountains.
WSATM


 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
ATRTFATVOTTT
hasted away.
HA


 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys
TGUBTMTGDBTV
unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
UTPWTHFFT


 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
THSABTTMNPOTT
turn not again to cover the earth.
TNATCTE


 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
HSTSITVWRAT
hills.
H


 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
TGDTEBOTFTWA
quench their thirst.
QTT


 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
BTSTFOTHHTH
which sing among the branches.
WSATB


 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
HWTHFHCTEI
satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
SWTFOTW


 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for
HCTGTGFTCAHF
the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
TSOMTHMBFFOOTE


 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
AWTMGTHOMAOTM
his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
HFTSABWSMH


 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of
TTOTLAFOSTCO
Lebanon, which he hath planted;
LWHHP


 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
WTBMTNAFTSTF
trees are her house.
TAHH


 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the
THHAARFTWGAT
rocks for the conies.
RFTC


 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
HATMFSTSKHG
down.
D


 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the
TMDAIINWAT
beasts of the forest do creep forth.
BOTFDCF


 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
TYLRATPASTM
from God.
FG


 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay
TSATGTTAL
them down in their dens.
TDITD


 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
MGFUHWATHLUT
evening.
E


 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
OLHMATWIWHTM
them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
TATEIFOTR


 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
SITGAWSWATC
innumerable, both small and great beasts.
IBSAGB


 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
TGTSTITLWTH
made to play therein.
MTPT


 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
TWAUTTTMGTT
meat in due season.
MIDS


 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
TTGTTGTOTH
they are filled with good.
TAFWG


 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
THTFTATTTA
their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
TBTDARTTD


 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
TSFTSTACAT
renewest the face of the earth.
RTFOTE


 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
TGOTLSEFETLS
rejoice in his works.
RIHW


 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
HLOTEAITHTT
hills, and they smoke.
HATS


 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
IWSUTLALAILIWS
praise to my God while I have my being.
PTMGWIHMB


 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
MMOHSBSIWBGIT
LORD.
L


 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
LTSBCOOTEALT
wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
WBNMBTTLOMSPYTL


 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
OGTUTLCUHNMK
his deeds among the people.
HDATP


 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
SUHSPUHTYOAH
wondrous works.
WW


 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice
GYIHHNLTHOTR
that seek the LORD.
TSTL


 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
STLAHSSHFE


 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his
RHMWTHHDH
wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
WATJOHM


 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
OYSOAHSYCOJH
chosen.
C


 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
HITLOGHJAIATE


 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
HHRHCFETWWH
commanded to a thousand generations.
CTATG


 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto
WCHMWAAHOU
Isaac;
I


 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel
ACTSUJFALATI
for an everlasting covenant:
FAEC


 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
SUTWIGTLOCTLO
your inheritance:
YI


 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
WTWBAFMINYVFA
strangers in it.
SII


 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom
WTWFONTAFOK
to another people;
TAP


 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
HSNMTDTWYHRK
for their sakes;
FTS


 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
STNMAADMPNH


 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
MHCFAFUTLHBT
whole staff of bread.
WSOB


 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
HSAMBTEJWWSFA
servant:
S


 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
WFTHWFHWLII


 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD
UTTTHWCTWOTL
tried him.
TH


 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
TKSALHETROTP
and let him go free.
ALHGF


 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his
HMHLOHHAROAH
substance:
S


 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
TBHPAHPATHS
wisdom.
W


 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
IACIEAJSITL
of Ham.
OH


 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
AHIHPGAMTS
than their enemies.
TTE


 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
HTTHTHHPTDS
with his servants.
WHS


 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
HSMHSAAWHHC


 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
TSHSATAWITLO
Ham.
H


 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
HSDAMIDATRN
against his word.
AHW


 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
HTTWIBASTF


 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
TLBFFIAITC
of their kings.
OTK


 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
HSATCDSOFALI
all their coasts.
ATC


 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
HGTHFRAFFITL


 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
HSTVAATFTABT
trees of their coasts.
TOTC


 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
HSATLCACAT
without number,
WN


 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
ADEUATHITLADT
fruit of their ground.
FOTG


 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
HSAATFITLTCO
all their strength.
ATS


 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there
HBTFAWSAGAT
was not one feeble person among their tribes.
WNOFPATT


 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
EWGWTDFTFOTF
upon them.
UT


 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
HSACFACAFTGLI
the night.
TN


 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
TPAAHBQAST
with the bread of heaven.
WTBOH


 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in
HOTRATWGOTRI
the dry places like a river.
TDPLAR


 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
FHRHHPAAHS


 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen
AHBFHPWJAHC
with gladness:
WG


 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited
AGTTLOTHATI
the labour of the people;
TLOTP


 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
TTMOHSAKHL
Praise ye the LORD.
PYTL


 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
PYTLOGTUTLFHI
good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
GFHMEFE


 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew
WCUTMAOTLWCS
forth all his praise?
FAHP


 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
BATTKJAHTD
righteousness at all times.
RAAT


 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
RMOLWTFTTBU
thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
TPOVMWTS


 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
TIMSTGOTCTIMRI
the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
TGOTNTIMGWTI


 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
WHSWOFWHCI
we have done wickedly.
WHDW


 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
OFUNTWIET
remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the
RNTMOTMBPHAT
sea, even at the Red sea.
SEATRS


 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he
NHSTFHNSTH
might make his mighty power to be known.
MMHMPTBK


 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
HRTRSAAIWDUSHL
them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
TTTDATTW


 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
AHSTFTHOHTHTA
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
RTFTHOTE


 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
ATWCTETWNOO
them left.
TL


 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
TBTHWTSHP


 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
TSFHWTWNFHC


 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
BLEITWATGI
the desert.
TD


 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
AHGTTRBSLIT
soul.
S


 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of
TEMAITCAATSO
the LORD.
TL


 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
TEOASUDACT
company of Abiram.
COA


 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
AAFWKITCTFBU
the wicked.
TW


 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
TMACIHAWTMI


 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
TTCTGITSOAO
that eateth grass.
TEG


 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things
TFGTSWHDGT
in Egypt;
IE


 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by
WWITLOHATTB
the Red sea.
TRS


 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
THSTHWDTHNM
his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest
HCSBHITBTTAHWL
he should destroy them.
HSDT


 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
YTDTPLTBNH
word:
W


 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the
BMITTAHNUT
voice of the LORD.
VOTL


 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
THLUHHATTO
them in the wilderness:
TITW


 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to
TOTSAATNAT
scatter them in the lands.
STITL


 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
TJTAUBAAT
sacrifices of the dead.
SOTD


 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and
TTPHTAWTIA
the plague brake in upon them.
TPBIUT


 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
TSUPAEJAST
plague was stayed.
PWS


 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
ATWCUHFRUA
generations for evermore.
GFE


 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it
TAHAATWOSSTI
went ill with Moses for their sakes:
WIWMFTS


 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake
BTPHSSTHS
unadvisedly with his lips.
UWHL


 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
TDNDTNCWTL
commanded them:
CT


 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
BWMATHALTW


 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
ATSTIWWASUT


 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
YTSTSATDU
devils,
D


 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
ASIBETBOTSAO
their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the
TDWTSUTIOCAT
land was polluted with blood.
LWPWB


 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
TWTDWTOWAWA
whoring with their own inventions.
WWTOI


 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
TWTWOTLKAH
people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
PITHAHOI


 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
AHGTITHOTHATT
hated them ruled over them.
HTROT


 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought
TEAOTATWB
into subjection under their hand.
ISUTH


 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
MTDHDTBTPHW
their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
TCAWBLFTI


 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard
NHRTAWHH
their cry:
TC


 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
AHRFTHCAR
according to the multitude of his mercies.
ATTMOHM


 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried
HMTATBPOATTC
them captives.
TC


 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the
SUOLOGAGUFAT
heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
HTGTUTHNATTIT
praise.
P


 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
BBTLGOIFET
everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
EALATPSAPYTL


 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
OGTUTLFHIGFHM
endureth for ever.
EFE


 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
LTROTLSSWHHR
from the hand of the enemy;
FTHOTE


 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
AGTOOTLFTEAF
the west, from the north, and from the south.
TWFTNAFTS


 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they
TWITWIASWT
found no city to dwell in.
FNCTDI


 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
HATTSFIT


 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
TTCUTLITTAH
delivered them out of their distresses.
DTOOTD


 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go
AHLTFBTRWTTMG
to a city of habitation.
TACOH


 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
OTMWPTLFHGAF
his wonderful works to the children of men!
HWWTTCOM


 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
FHSTLSAFTH
soul with goodness.
SWG


 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
SASIDAITSODB
bound in affliction and iron;
BIAAI


 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and
BTRATWOGA
contemned the counsel of the most High:
CTCOTMH


 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
THBDTHWLTF
down, and there was none to help.
DATWNTH


 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
TTCUTLITTAHS
them out of their distresses.
TOOTD


 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
HBTOODATSODA
brake their bands in sunder.
BTBIS


 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
OTMWPTLFHGAF
his wonderful works to the children of men!
HWWTTCOM


 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
FHHBTGOBACTBO
iron in sunder.
IIS


 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
FBOTTABOT
iniquities, are afflicted.
IAA


 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
TSAAMOMATDN
unto the gates of death.
UTGOD


 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
TTCUTLITTAHS
them out of their distresses.
TOOTD


 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
HSHWAHTADTF
their destructions.
TD


 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
OTMWPTLFHGAF
his wonderful works to the children of men!
HWWTTCOM


 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
ALTSTSOTA
declare his works with rejoicing.
DHWWR


 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
TTGDTTSISTDBI
great waters;
GW


 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the
TSTWOTLAHWIT
deep.
D


 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which
FHCARTSWW
lifteth up the waves thereof.
LUTWT


 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the
TMUTTHTGDATT
depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
DTSIMBOT


 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and
TRTAFASLADMA
are at their wit's end.
AATWE


 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
TTCUTLITTAH
bringeth them out of their distresses.
BTOOTD


 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
HMTSACSTTWTA
still.
S


 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth
TATGBTBQSHB
them unto their desired haven.
TUTDH


 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
OTMWPTLFHGAF
his wonderful works to the children of men!
HWWTTCOM


 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
LTEHAITCOTP
and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
APHITAOTE


 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings
HTRIAWATW
into dry ground;
IDG


 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
AFLIBFTWOT
that dwell therein.
TDT


 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
HTTWIASWAD
ground into watersprings.
GIW


 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may
ATHMTHTDTTM
prepare a city for habitation;
PACFH


 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
ASTFAPVWMY
fruits of increase.
FOI


 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
HBTASTTAMG
and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
ASNTCTD


 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
ATAMABLTO
affliction, and sorrow.
AAS


 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
HPCUPACTTW
in the wilderness, where there is no way.
ITWWTINW


 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
YSHTPOHFAAM
him families like a flock.
HFLAF


 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
TRSSIARAAI
shall stop her mouth.
SSHM


 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they
WIWAWOTTET
shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
SUTLOTL


 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
OGMHIFIWSAGPE
with my glory.
WMG


 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
APAHIMWAE


 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will
IWPTOLATPAIW
sing praises unto thee among the nations.
SPUTATN


 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
FTMIGATHATT
reacheth unto the clouds.
RUTC


 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory
BTEOGATHATG
above all the earth;
AATE


 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
TTBMBDSWTRH
and answer me.
AAM


 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will
GHSIHHIWRIW
divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
DSAMOTVOS


 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
GIMMIMEAIT
strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
SOMHJIML


 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
MIMWOEWICOMSO
Philistia will I triumph.
PWIT


 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me
WWBMITSCWWLM
into Edom?
IE


 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not
WNTOGWHCUOAWN
thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
TOGGFWOH


 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
GUHFTFVITHOM


 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
TGWSDVFHIITS
tread down our enemies.
TDOE


 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
HNTPOGOMP


 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful
FTMOTWATMOTD
are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
AOAMTHSAMWALT


 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and
TCMAAWWOHA
fought against me without a cause.
FAMWAC


 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
FMLTAMABIGMU
prayer.
P


 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
ATHRMEFGAHFM
love.
L


 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
STAWMOHALSSAH
right hand.
RH


 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
WHSBJLHBCALH
prayer become sin.
PBS


 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
LHDBFALATHO


 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
LHCBFAHWAW


 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
LHCBCVABLT
seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
STBAOOTDP


 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
LTECATHHALT
strangers spoil his labour.
SSHL


 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let
LTBNTEMUHNL
there be any to favour his fatherless children.
TBATFHFC


 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation
LHPBCOAITG
following let their name be blotted out.
FLTNBBO


 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
LTIOHFBRWTL
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
ALNTSOHMBBO


 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
LTBBTLCTHMCO
the memory of them from the earth.
TMOTFTE


 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
BTHRNTSMBP
the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
TPANMTHMESTBIH


 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he
AHLCSLICUHAH
delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
DNIBSLIBFFH


 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
AHCHWCLAWHG
so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
SLICIHBLWALOIHB


 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and
LIBUHATGWCHA
for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
FAGWHIGC


 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD,
LTBTROMAFTL
and of them that speak evil against my soul.
AOTTSEAMS


 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
BDTFMOGTLFTNS
because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
BTMIGDTM


 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
FIAPANAMHIWWM


 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
IAGLTSWIDIATU
and down as the locust.
ADATL


 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
MKAWTFAMFFO
fatness.
F


 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
IBAARUTWTLUM
they shaked their heads.
TSTH


 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
HMOLMGOSMATTM


 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
TTMKTTITHTTL
hast done it.
HDI


 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
LTCBBTWTALTB
ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
ABLTSR


 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them
LMABCWSALT
cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
CTWTOCAWAM


 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
IWGPTLWMMYIW
praise him among the multitude.
PHATM


 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save
FHSSATRHOTPTS
him from those that condemn his soul.
HFTTCHS


 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until
TLSUMLSTAMRHU
I make thine enemies thy footstool.
IMTETF


 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion:
TLSSTROTSOOZ
rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
RTITMOTE


 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
TPSBWITDOTPIT
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of
BOHFTWOTMTHTDO
thy youth.
TY


 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
TLHSAWNRTAAP
for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
FEATOOM


 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
TLATRHSSTKIT
day of his wrath.
DOHW


 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
HSJATHHSFTP
with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
WTDBHSWTHOMC


 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
HSDOTBITWTSH
lift up the head.
LUTH


 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole

heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
HITAOTUAITC


 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that

mindful of his covenant.

uprightness.

 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall

 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
HSNBAOETHHIF
trusting in the LORD.

 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he
HHIEHSNBAUH
see his desire upon his enemies.

 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his

his people.

 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a

 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
TTEATPOTLAT
presence of the God of Jacob;

 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into

a fountain of waters.

masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
MAATEOAMUTHOHMS
our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
OEWUTLOGUTHHMUU


 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
HMUUOLHMUUFWA
exceedingly filled with contempt.
EFWC


 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those
OSIEFWTSOT
that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
TAAEAWTCOTP


 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
IIHNBTLWWOOSNM
Israel say;
IS


 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men
IIHNBTLWWOOSWM
rose up against us:
RUAU


 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
TTHSUUQWTWW
kindled against us:
KAU


 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
TTWHOUTSHGO
our soul:
OS


 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
TTPWHGOOS


 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to
BBTLWHNGUAAPT
their teeth.
TT


 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the
OSIEAABOOTSOT
fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
FTSIBAWAE


 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
OHIITNOTLWMHA
earth.
E


 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
TTTITLSBAMZW
cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
CBRBAFE


 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
ATMARAJSTLI
round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
RAHPFHEFE


 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
FTROTWSNRUTLOT
righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
RLTRPFTHUI


 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that
DGOLUTTBGATTT
are upright in their hearts.
AUITH


 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
AFSATAUTCWTL
shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be
SLTFWTWOIBPSB
upon Israel.
UI


 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were
WTLTATCOZWW
like them that dream.
LTTD


 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
TWOMFWLAOTW
singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great
STSTATHTLHDG
things for them.
TFT


 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
TLHDGTFUWWAG


 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the
TAOCOLATSIT
south.
S


 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
TTSITSRIJ


 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
HTGFAWBPS
shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
SDCAWRBHSW
him.
H


 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
ETLBTHTLIVT
build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in
BIETLKTCTWWBI
vain.
V


 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
IIVFYTRUETSULTE
the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
TBOSFSHGHBS


 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of
LCAAHOTLATFO
the womb is his reward.
TWIHR


 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children
AAAITHOAMMSAC
of the youth.
OTY


 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they
HITMTHHQFOTT
shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
SNBABTSSWTEIT
gate.
G


 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
BIEOTFTLTWI
his ways.
HW


 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt
FTSETLOTHHS
thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
TBAISBWWT


 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
TWSBAAFVBTSOT
house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
HTCLOPRATT


 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
BTTSTMBBTFT
LORD.
L


 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see
TLSBTOOZATSS
the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
TGOJATDOTL


 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
YTSSTCCAPU
Israel.
I


 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
MATHTAMFMYMI
now say:
NS


 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
MATHTAMFMYYT
have not prevailed against me.
HNPAM


 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their
TPPUMBTMLT
furrows.
F


 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
TLIRHHCATCOT
wicked.
W


 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
LTABCATBTHZ


 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
LTBATGUTHWW
afore it groweth up:
AIGU


 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that
WTMFNHHNHT
bindeth sheaves his bosom.
BSHB


 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
NDTWGBSTBOTLB
upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
UYWBYITNOTL


 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
OOTDHICUTOL


 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the
LHMVLTEBATT
voice of my supplications.
VOMS


 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
ITLSMIOLWS
stand?
S


 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
BTIFWTTTMB
feared.
F


 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
IWFTLMSDWAIHWDI
hope.
H


 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for
MSWFTLMTTTWF
the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
TMISMTTTWFTM


 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is
LIHITLFWTLTI
mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
MAWHIPR


 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
AHSRIFAHI


 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither
LMHINHNMELN
do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
DIEMIGMOITTHFM


 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
SIHBAQMAACTI
weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
WOHMMSIEAAWC


 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
LIHITLFHAFE


 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
LRDAAHA


 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
HHSUTLAVUTMGO
Jacob;
J


 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor
SIWNCITTOMHN
go up into my bed;
GUIMB


 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
IWNGSTMEOSTM
eyelids,
E


 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
UIFOAPFTLAHFT
mighty God of Jacob.
MGOJ


 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
LWHOIAEWFIITFO
the wood.
TW


 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
WWGIHTWWWAH
footstool.
F


 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
AOLITRTATAOT
strength.
S


 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
LTPBCWRALT
saints shout for joy.
SSFJ


 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
FTSDSTNATFOT
anointed.
A


 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn
TLHSITUDHWNT
from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
FIOTFOTBWISUTT


 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that
ITCWKMCAMTT
I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for
ISTTTCSASUTTF
evermore.
E


 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
FTLHCZHHDIFH
habitation.
H


 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
TIMRFEHWIDFIH
desired it.
DI


 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her
IWABHPIWSH
poor with bread.
PWB


 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her
IWACHPWSAH
saints shall shout aloud for joy.
SSSAFJ


 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained
TWIMTHODTBIHO
a lamp for mine anointed.
ALFMA


 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
HEWICWSBUHS
his crown flourish.
HCF


 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to
BHGAHPIIFBT
dwell together in unity!
DTIU


 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran
IILTPOUTHTR
down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts
DUTBEABTWDTTS
of his garments;
OHG


 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
ATDOHAATDTDUT
mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life
MOZFTTLCTBEL
for evermore.
FE


 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD,
BBYTLAYSOTL
which by night stand in the house of the LORD.
WBNSITHOTL


 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

YTSITHOTLITCOT
house of our God.
HOOG


 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
PTLFTLIGSPUH
name; for it is pleasant.
NFIIP


 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
FTLHCJUHAIF
his peculiar treasure.
HPT


 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is
FIKTTLIGATOLI
above all gods.
AAG


 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
WTLPTDHIHAI
earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
EITSAADP


 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
HCTVTAFTEOTE
he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his
HMLFTRHBTWOOH
treasuries.
T


 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
WSTFOEBOMAB


 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
WSTAWITMOTOE
upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
UPAUAHS


 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
WSGNASMK


 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all
SKOTAAOKOBAA
the kingdoms of Canaan:
TKOC


 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
AGTLFAHAHUI
his people.
HP


 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O
TNOLEFEATMO
LORD, throughout all generations.
LTAG


 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent
FTLWJHPAHWR
himself concerning his servants.
HCHS


 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
TIOTHASAGTWO
men's hands.
MH


 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but
THMBTSNEHTB
they see not;
TSN


 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any
THEBTHNNITA
breath in their mouths.
BITM


 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
TTMTALUTSIEOT
trusteth in them.

 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
BTROBTWSDYWW

WWRZ


 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
WHOHUTWITMT


 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
FTTTCUACROUA
song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one
SATTWUROUMSSUO
of the songs of Zion.
OTSOZ


 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her

cunning.

Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.

 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot

secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

way everlasting.

violent man;

lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

LDIMMS


 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my

trouble.

 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest

my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for
MPITWWIWHTPLASF
me.

 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man

portion in the land of the living.
PITLOTL


 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me
AUMCFIABVLDM

 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
BMSOOPTIMPTNT
righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with

me.

faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
FAMAITR


 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy

 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to

good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine

great waters, from the hand of strange children;
GWFTHOSC

hand of falsehood.
